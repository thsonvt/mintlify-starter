## Promotion workflow

1. Approve valid suggestions on this page.
2. Promote approved suggestions into `/Users/sonle/Github/ai-thought-leadership/config/sources.yaml` using:

```bash
cd /Users/sonle/Github/mintlify-starter/scripts
npm run suggestions:promote -- --sources-file /Users/sonle/Github/ai-thought-leadership/config/sources.yaml
```

3. Use "Mark promoted" here to keep tracking state aligned when needed.
