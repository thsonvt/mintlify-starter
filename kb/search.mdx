# Semantic Search

Search through curated AI thought leadership content using natural language queries. Our semantic search understands meaning, not just keywords.

## How It Works

1. **Enter your question** - Use natural language like "How should I plan before coding with AI?"
2. **Filter results** - Narrow by author, topic, or content type (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)
3. **Explore matches** - Click any result to read the full article
