# Semantic Search

Search through curated AI thought leadership content using natural language queries. Our semantic search understands meaning, not just keywords.

<Tip>
  **Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows)** to open the search modal and find articles instantly.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Search works across both Framework documentation and Knowledge Base articles. Results link directly to local content for offline reading.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Enter your question** - Use natural language like "How should I plan before coding with AI?"
2. **Filter results** - Narrow by author, topic, or content type (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)
3. **Explore matches** - Click any result to read the full article

## Content Sources

We track thought leadership from:

## Diátaxis Content Types

Articles are classified using the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/):

| Type | Purpose | Example Query |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Tutorial** | Learning-oriented | "How to build my first AI agent" |
| **How-to** | Task-oriented | "Fix context window limits" |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented | "Claude API parameters" |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented | "Why agents need better planning" |
