**Lazar Jovanovic** is a full-time professional vibe coder at Lovable. His job is to build both internal tools and customer-facing products purely using AI, while not having a coding background. In this conversation, he breaks down the tactics, workflows, and framework that let him ship production-quality products using only AI.

**Listen on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/0XNkUdzxiZI), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ahlEY555QxiUJDO8Z0GV3?si=m6XyrJ1mQcWGOibtnl1P1g), and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/getting-paid-to-vibe-code-inside-the-new-ai-era-job/id1627920305?i=1000748773583)**

### We discuss:

1. Why having no coding background can be an advantage when building with AI
2. Why most of your time should go to planning and chat mode, not prompting
3. What to do when you get stuck: his 4x4 debugging workflow
4. The PRD and Markdown file system that keeps AI agents aligned across complex builds
5. Why kicking off four or five parallel prototypes is the best way to clarify your thinking
6. Why design skills and taste are going to be the most important skills in the future
7. His “genie and three wishes” mental model for making the most of AI’s limitations
8. How product, engineering, and design roles are converging—and what that means for your career

## My biggest takeaways from this conversation:

1. **Vibe coding is now a full-time professional career.** Lazar Jovanovic gets paid to build internal tools and public-facing products using AI tools like Lovable. His work ranges from Shopify integrations and merch stores that handle real transactions to complex internal dashboards tracking feature adoption. Companies across the S&P 500 are actively hiring people with these skills.
2. **Not having a technical background can be an advantage when vibe coding.** People without engineering experience don’t know what’s “supposedly impossible,” so they try things that technical people might dismiss. Lazar built Chrome extensions and desktop apps with Lovable because he didn’t know the technical reasons why those shouldn’t work. The willingness to try anything until proven wrong unlocks capabilities others overlook.
3. **Coding is no longer the bottleneck—clarity is.** Lazar spends 80% of his time planning and chatting with AI agents and only 20% building. The ceiling on AI output isn’t model intelligence; it’s what the model is told and shown before it acts. Your job is to provide clear context and instructions, not to write code.
4. **AI tools have a limited context window that you must manage deliberately.** Think of it like a genie granting you three wishes. Every request consumes tokens for reading, thinking, and executing. If you dump vague requests, the AI spends the most tokens figuring out what you want and has little left for quality output.
5. **Start five parallel builds to find clarity faster.** Instead of overthinking one design, brain dump into the first project, get more specific in the second, add visual references in the third, attach actual code snippets in the fourth, and compare all five. This costs more up front but saves hundreds of credits and days of iteration later.
6. **Create four PRD files before serious building begins:** master plan (what and why), implementation plan (sequence of work), design guidelines (visual parameters), and user journeys (how people navigate). These feed into a tasks.md file that breaks everything into executable steps. The agent reads these files before each prompt.
7. **When you get stuck, follow this four-step debugging sequence.** First, let the tool try to fix it. Second, add console logs to track what’s happening and paste the output back to the agent. Third, bring in an external tool like Codex for deeper diagnosis. Fourth, revert a few steps and try a cleaner prompt.
8. **Use rules files to make your findings permanent.** After solving a problem, ask the AI how to prompt it better next time, and then add that guidance to your rules.md file. The agent reads these rules on every request, so you’re training it to handle your weaknesses automatically.
9. **Design and taste are becoming increasingly valuable in the AI era.** When everyone can produce good-enough output instantly, the people who stand out are those who understand emotional design decisions—fonts, spacing, micro-interactions—that AI can’t yet replicate well. Invest time in studying elite design work.
10. **Build in public to land vibe-coding jobs.** Lazar got hired at Lovable because he was already shipping projects, teaching on YouTube, and sharing knowledge on LinkedIn. Hires at Lovable submitted Lovable apps instead of resumes. The fastest path to a professional vibe-coding role is doing the job before anyone pays you for it.
