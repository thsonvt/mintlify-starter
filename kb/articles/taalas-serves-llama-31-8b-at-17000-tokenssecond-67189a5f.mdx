**[Taalas serves Llama 3.1 8B at 17,000 tokens/second](https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/)**

This new Canadian hardware startup just announced their first product - a custom hardware implementation of the Llama 3.1 8B model (from [July 2024](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/23/introducing-llama-31/)) that can run at a staggering 17,000 tokens/second.

I was going to include a video of their demo but it's so fast it would look more like a screenshot. You can try it out at [chatjimmy.ai](https://chatjimmy.ai).

They describe their Silicon Llama as “aggressively quantized, combining 3-bit and 6-bit parameters.” Their next generation will use 4-bit - presumably they have quite a long lead time for baking out new models!
