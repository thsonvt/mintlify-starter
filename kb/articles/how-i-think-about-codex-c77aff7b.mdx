## Full Article

22nd February 2026 - Link Blog How I think about Codex. Gabriel Chua (Developer Experience Engineer for APAC at OpenAI) provides his take on the confusing terminology behind the term "Codex", which can refer to a bunch of of different things within the OpenAI ecosystem: In plain terms, Codex is OpenAI’s software engineering agent, available through multiple interfaces, and an agent is a model plus instructions and tools, wrapped in a runtime that can execute tasks on your behalf. [...] At a high level, I see Codex as three parts working together: Codex = Model + Harness + Surfaces [...] Model + Harness = the Agent Surfaces = how you interact with the Agent He defines the harness as "the collection of instructions and tools", which is notably open source and lives in the openai/codex repository. Gabriel also provides the first acknowledgment I've seen from an OpenAI insider that the Codex model family are directly trained for the Codex harness: Codex models are trained in the presence of the harness. Tool use, execution loops, compaction, and iterative verification aren’t bolted on behaviors — they’re part of how the model learns to operate. The harness, in turn, is shaped around how the model plans, invokes tools, and recovers from failure.
