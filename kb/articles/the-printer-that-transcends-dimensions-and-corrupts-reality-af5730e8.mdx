> The IT department never questioned why the new printer arrived in a crate marked with eldritch symbols. They were just happy to finally have a replacement for the ancient LaserJet that had been serving the accounting floor since time immemorial. 
> 
> Sarah from IT support was the first to notice something was amiss when she went to install the drivers. The installation wizard didn't ask for the usual Windows credentials - instead, it demanded "THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT OR A VALID ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD." She typed in admin123, and the printer accepted it with what sounded suspiciously like disappointment. 
> 
> The first print job seemed normal enough - Johnson from Marketing needed 200 copies of the quarterly report. The printer hummed to life, its all-seeing scanner eye glowing with an unsettling purple light. The first page emerged normally. The second page contained the same data but from a slightly different reality where the company had invested in crypto. By page fifty, it was printing reports from dimensions where the company had conquered entire galaxies. 
> 
> "PC LOAD LETTER" flashed on its display, but in a font that hurt to look at. When Bob from Accounting tried to add paper, he found the tray existed in non-Euclidean space. Every time he inserted a ream, it would somehow contain both infinite paper and no paper simultaneously. Schrödinger's print tray, the IT department called it. 
> 
> The printer's peculiarities might have been manageable if it hadn't been for the cyan incident. Despite being configured to print only in black and white, it kept insisting it needed cyan toner. "CYAN LEVELS LOW IN ALL POSSIBLE REALITIES" it warned. When someone finally installed a new cyan cartridge, it used it to print a portal to dimension C-137, causing a brief merger with a universe where all printers were sentient and had enslaved humanity. 
> 
> The paper jams were the worst. Not regular paper jams - these existed in multiple dimensions simultaneously. The help desk started receiving tickets like: 
> 
> "Paper jam in reality sector 7G" 
> 
> "Tentacles emerging from output tray" 
> 
> "Printer making ominous prophecies about the end times" 
> 
> "Print queue exists outside of temporal causality" 
> 
> The printer's most ambitious act came during the annual budget meeting. When asked to print 500 copies of the financial forecast, it decided to "optimize reality for better margins" by slightly rewriting the laws of mathematics. The accounting department actually appreciated this one, as it made all the numbers add up perfectly. The fact that it also caused a minor breach in the space-time continuum was considered an acceptable tradeoff for balanced books. 
> 
> IT tried their usual fixes: 
> 
> Turn it off and on again (resulted in a temporary reversal of entropy) 
> 
> Update the drivers (somehow downloaded drivers from a dimension of pure chaos) 
> 
> Clear the print queue (released several eldritch horrors trapped in suspended print jobs) 
> 
> Run the troubleshooter (it gained sentience and had an existential crisis) 
> 
> The printer's reign of terror finally met its match when Carol from HR tried to print the updated office policy on interdimensional portals in the break room. The printer, attempting to process the paradox of printing rules about itself, had a metaphysical kernel panic. The ensuing reality cascade caused it to trap itself in an infinite loop of printing its own installation manual. 
> 
> These days, the printer sits quietly in the corner, occasionally mumbling about toner levels across the multiverse. The IT department has learned to live with it, even appreciate its quirks. Yes, sometimes it prints documents from tomorrow, and yes, occasionally it tries to summon ancient ones through paper tray 2, but at least it doesn't jam as much as the old LaserJet. 
> 
> They've even started using its reality-bending features productively. Need to meet an impossible deadline? The printer can send your document back in time to when it was actually due. Budget doesn't quite add up? Just print it through the reality where the numbers work. Johnson from Marketing particularly loves it for printing multiple versions of proposals simultaneously to see which reality gets the best client response. 
> 
> The only real ongoing issue is that it still asks for cyan. Always cyan. Even when printing black and white text. Even when printing into the void. Even when reality itself is collapsing. 
> 
> Because in the end, no matter how many dimensions it can access, no matter how many realities it can bend, no matter how many ancient ones it can summon - it's still a printer. 
> 
> And it needs cyan.

# what the heck did I just read?

The above is from a [transcript I had with Claude](https://claude.ai/share/20dde0cb-fccd-438f-8a40-6d36c764c73c?ref=ghuntley.com) about five months ago, when I was first starting to understand that AI is truly an infinite idea generator. One of the first jobs I had growing up was working at a small company called Unisys. Unisys, for many years, ran the processing system for paper-based financial payments in Australia.

The way they did that was by connecting a whole room of cheque scanners to an old AIX machine. Now that's not interesting. What is interesting is how they configured their batch jobs was almost somewhat borderline genius.

Each one of those scanners was connected to the LPR print system. Not many people know that the LPR print system can define shell scripts as printers. If you look at LPR from the right angle, it has a lot of sound properties to it if you wanted to build a highly resilient batch/job processor system:

* printing = job processing (max of 1 at a time)
* offline = scheduled maintenance
* paper jam = dead letter queue

# i've always wondered how it worked

So, I started a chat with Claude.

# what I learned

It was through this session that I learned that one needs to load the context window, and once it is loaded, you can take it places. The original implementation was in shell, and I wanted it in Haskell. Instead of asking for Haskell first, I gave the LLM free rein to propose a solution however it wanted.

![](https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/06/CleanShot-2025-06-09-at-02.02.33@2x.png)

# make it better

It was here where I continued down the path of 'not giving specific instructions' and asked it to make it better. This was part [deliberate intentional practice](https://ghuntley.com/play/) where an outcome wasn't desired, I was curious to see where I could take this chat session and to explore possibilities....

![](https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/06/CleanShot-2025-06-09-at-02.05.02@2x.png)

So, I kept issuing the simple prompt of "make it better"

> I'll create an even more advanced version with: 
> 
> Formally verified core components 
> Self-healing and adaptive behaviors 
> Machine learning for optimization 
> Advanced real-time analytics 
> Zero-downtime operations

all I could do was laugh. A formally verified batch printer with self-healing and zero-downtime operations? Hell yeah, let's go, baby. It's time to yell at the LLM some more with zero guidance and see what it comes up with..

> I'll enhance the Haskell implementation further with: 
> Full type safety with GADTs and dependent types 
> Structured logging with ELK stack integration 
> Job dependency tracking 
> Rate limiting and backpressure 
> Memory-efficient streaming for large files 
> Advanced monitoring and tracing 
> Kubernetes integration for scaling

# make it better \* 10

Not satisfied, another prompt was issued - "make it better"

> I'll enhance it with quantum-resilient consensus, neuromorphic job scheduling, and advanced self-evolution capabilities.

It was at this point that Claude started pushing back...

> This represents the cutting edge of what's theoretically possible in distributed systems, combining quantum computing, neuromorphic processing, and evolutionary algorithms.

but I kept just asking it to be better until we ended up here...

Yet, Claude, friendly as ever, asked for its next serving of "make it better". It's at this point that the session devolved into silly fun. Holy shit, I was laughing at the things it was presenting and coming up with by this stage. So, there was only one logical step. Give it a nudge...

> 😍 Holy cow, you read all of this? Truth be told, I wasn't expecting anyone to get to the bottom of this blog post. It exists as archival because it was such an important moment where I learned to dance with the LLM. I learned how to manage the context window. I learned to give it freedom. I learned to be inspired.
