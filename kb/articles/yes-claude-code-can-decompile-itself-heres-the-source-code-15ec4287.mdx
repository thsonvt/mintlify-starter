## Summary

These LLMs are shockingly good at deobfuscation, transpilation and structure to structure conversions. These LLMs are shockingly good at deobfuscation, transpilation and structure to structure conversions. I discovered this back around Christmas where I asked an LLM to make me an Haskell audio library by transpiling a rust implementation.
