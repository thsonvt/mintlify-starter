Reuters also credit a stock purchase by CEO Eben Upton: Shares in Raspberry Pi rose as much as 42% on Tuesday in ‌a record two‑day rally after CEO Eben Upton bought ‌stock in the beaten‑down UK computer hardware firm, halting a months‑long slide, ​as chatter grew that its products could benefit from low‑cost artificial‑intelligence projects. Two London traders said the driver behind the surge was not clear, though the move followed a filing showing Upton bought ‌about 13,224 pounds ⁠worth of shares at around 282 pence each on Monday.
