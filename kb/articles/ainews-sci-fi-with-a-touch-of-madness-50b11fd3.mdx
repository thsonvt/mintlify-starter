Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1753** minutes. [AINews’ website](https://news.smol.ai/) lets you search all past issues. As a reminder, [AINews is now a section of Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/p/2026). You can [opt in/out](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/8914938285204-How-do-I-subscribe-to-or-unsubscribe-from-a-section-on-Substack) of email frequencies!*

Harvey is rumored to be [raising at $11B](https://x.com/pitdesi/status/2020883963154440437), which triggers our decacorn rule, except we don’t count our chickens before they are announced. We have also released a [lightning pod today with Pratyush Maini of Datology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSgjaC6y6Mk&t=1444s) on his work [tracing reasoning data footprints in GPT training data](https://x.com/pratyushmaini/status/2001824826353418433).

But on an otherwise low news day, we think back to a phrase we read in Armin Ronacher’s [Pi: The Minimal Agent Within OpenClaw](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/31/pi/):

```
[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8fAR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ba15034-2dd7-4e35-b07e-4e07638e34ca_1070x628.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8fAR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ba15034-2dd7-4e35-b07e-4e07638e34ca_1070x628.png)
```

The point of Armin’s piece was that you should lean into “software that builds software” (key example: Pi doesn’t have an MCP integration, because with the 4 tools it has, it can trivially write a CLI that wraps the MCP and then use the CLI it just made). But we have higher level takeaways.

Even if you are an OpenClaw doubter/hater (*and yes this is our [third](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-ai-vs-saas-the-unreasonable) [post](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-moltbook-the-first-social) in 2 weeks about it, yes we don’t like overexposure/hype and this was not decided lightly — but errors of overambivalence are as bad or worse than errors of overexcitement*), you objectively have to accept that OpenClaw is now the most popular agent framework on earth, beating out many, many, many VC-backed open source agent companies with tens of millions of dollars in funding, beating out [Apple Intelligence](https://www.jakequist.com/thoughts/openclaw-is-what-apple-intelligence-should-have-been), beating out [talks from Meta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMoAaZP_Kkw), beating out closed personal agents like [Lindy](https://www.latent.space/p/lindy) and [Dust](https://www.latent.space/p/dust). When and if they join OpenAI ([you heard the prediction here first](https://x.com/swyx/status/2019255618192994463)) for hundreds of millions of dollars, **this may be the fastest open source “company” exit in human history (3 months start-to-finish).** (*It is very important to note that OpenClaw is committed to being free and open source forever*).

```
[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zIDE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5f18016-4b17-4837-b9da-82477cddb254_802x500.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zIDE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5f18016-4b17-4837-b9da-82477cddb254_802x500.jpeg)
```

Speculation aside, one of the more interesting firsts that OpenClaw also accomplishes is that it inverts the AI industry norm that the “open source version” of a thing usually is less popular and successful than the “closed source version” of a thing. This is a central driver of [The Agent Labs Thesis](https://www.latent.space/p/agent-labs) and is increasingly under attack what with [Ramp](https://x.com/zachbruggeman/status/2010728444771074493?s=46) and now [Stripe](https://stripe.dev/blog/minions-stripes-one-shot-end-to-end-coding-agents) showing that you can build your own agents with open source versions of popular closed source agents.

But again, we wonder how, JUST HOW, OpenClaw has been so successful.

In our quest for an answer, we coming back to the title quote: “Sci-Fi with a touch of Madness”. Pete made it **fun**, but also **sci-fi**, which also is the term that people used to [describe](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017296988589723767) the Moltbook phenomenon (probably short-lived, but early glimpses of Something).

```
[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bzhT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf834c9a-3530-46e6-9a2d-bed929ae85dd_1120x592.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bzhT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf834c9a-3530-46e6-9a2d-bed929ae85dd_1120x592.png)
```

It turns out that, when building in AI, having a **sincere yearning for science fiction** is actually a pretty important trait, and one which many AI pretenders failed to consider, to their own loss.

Don’t believe us? Ask a [guy](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020640004628742577?s=46) who has made his entire life building science fiction.

```

# **AI Twitter Recap**
```

**OpenAI’s Codex push (GPT‑5.3‑Codex) + “You can just build things” as a product strategy**

```
* **Super Bowl moment → Codex as the wedge**: OpenAI ran a Codex-centric Super Bowl ad anchored on “You can just build things” ([OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2020649757434327362); coverage in [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2020651347293716694), [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2020650521758179561)). The meta-story across the tweet set is that “builder tooling” (not chat) is becoming the mainstream consumer interface for frontier models.
* **Rollout and distribution**: OpenAI announced **GPT‑5.3‑Codex** rolling out across **Cursor, VS Code, and GitHub** with phased API access, explicitly flagging it as their **first “high cybersecurity capability”** model under the Preparedness Framework ([OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2020921792941166928); amplification by [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020940847190356092) and rollout rationale [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020940848159130094)). Cursor confirmed availability and preference internally (“noticeably faster than 5.2”) ([cursor\_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/2020921643145519249)).
* **Adoption metrics + developer growth loop**: Sam Altman claimed **1M+ Codex App downloads in the first week** and **60%+ weekly user growth**, with intent to keep free-tier access albeit possibly reduced limits ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020977975081177343)). Multiple dev posts reinforce a “permissionless building” narrative, including Codex being used to port apps to iOS/Swift and menu bar tooling ([@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2020616390974353880), [@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2020986458455277986)).
* **Real-world friction points**: Engineers report that 5.3 can still be overly literal in UI labeling ([kylebrussell](https://twitter.com/kylebrussell/status/2020927139546358171)), and rollout hiccups are acknowledged (paused rollout noted by VS Code account later) ([code](https://twitter.com/code/status/2021041639926673503)). There’s also ecosystem tension around model availability/partnership expectations (e.g., Cursor/OpenAI dynamics debated) ([Teknium](https://twitter.com/Teknium/status/2020659530162692568), later contradicted by actual rollout landing).
```

**Claude Opus 4.6, “fast mode,” and evals moving into a post-benchmark era**

```
* **Opus 4.6 as the “agentic generalist” baseline**: A recurring theme is that **Claude Opus 4.6** is perceived as the strongest overall interactive agent, while Codex is closing the gap for coding workflows (summarized explicitly by [natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/2020885646555107619) and his longer reflection on “post-benchmark” model reading [natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/2020881482873811070)).
* **Leaderboard performance with important caveats**: Opus 4.6 tops both **Text** and **Code Arena** leaderboards, with Anthropic holding 4/5 in Code Arena top 5 in one snapshot ([arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2020956227795288132)). On the niche **WeirdML** benchmark, Opus 4.6 leads but is described as **extremely token-hungry** (average ~32k output tokens; sometimes hitting 128k cap) ([htihle](https://twitter.com/htihle/status/2020845875447074874); discussion by [scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020847174909665712)).
* **Serving economics and “fast mode” behavior**: Several tweets focus on throughput/latency economics and the practical experience of different serving modes (e.g., “fast mode” for Opus, batch-serving discussions) ([kalomaze](https://twitter.com/kalomaze/status/2020747180408230142), [dejavucoder](https://twitter.com/dejavucoder/status/2020803250920808493)).
* **Practical agent-building pattern**: People are building surprisingly large apps with agent SDKs (e.g., a local agentic video editor, ~10k LOC) ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020912965885538664)). The throughline is that models are “good enough” that *workflow design*, tool choice, and harness quality dominate.
```

**Recursive Language Models (RLMs): long-context via “programmatic space” and recursion as a capability multiplier**

```
* **Core idea (2 context pools)**: RLMs are framed as giving models a second, **programmatic context space** (files/variables/tools) plus the token space, with the model deciding what to bring into tokens—turning long-context tasks into coding-style decomposition ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020723909491114294), [dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020723910724174283)). This is positioned as a generally applicable *test-time* strategy with lots of optimization headroom ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020994879078400408)).
* **Open-weights proof point**: The paper authors note they **post-trained and released** an open-weights **RLM‑Qwen3‑8B‑v0.1**, reporting a “marked jump in capability” and suggesting recursion might be “not too hard” to teach even at 8B scale ([lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/2020877152854409691)).
* **Hands-on implementation inside coding agents**: Tenobrus implemented an RLM-like recursive skill *within* Claude Code using bash/files as state; the demo claim is better full-book processing (Frankenstein named characters) vs naive single-pass behavior ([tenobrus](https://twitter.com/tenobrus/status/2020770310958768449)). This is important because it suggests RLM behavior can be partially realized as a **pattern** (harness + recursion) even before native model-level support.
* **Why engineers care**: RLM is repeatedly framed as “next big thing” because it operationalizes long-context and long-horizon work *without* assuming infinite context windows, and it aligns with agent tool-use primitives already common in coding agents ([DeryaTR\_](https://twitter.com/DeryaTR_/status/2020978003963244838)).
```

**MoE + sparsity + distributed training innovations (and skepticism about top‑k routing)**

```
* **New MoE comms pattern: Head Parallelism**: A highlighted systems result is **Multi‑Head LatentMoE + Head Parallelism**, aiming for **O(1) communication volume** w.r.t. number of activated experts, deterministic traffic, and better balance; claimed up to **1.61× faster** than standard MoE with expert parallelism and up to **4× less inter‑GPU communication (k=4)** ([TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2020884031630610484), [TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2020884105886593325)). This is exactly the kind of design that makes “>1000 experts” plausible operationally (commentary in [teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020767825715929332)).
* **Community tracking of sparsity**: Elie Bakouch compiled a visualization of expert vs parameter sparsity across many recent open MoEs (GLM, Qwen, DeepSeek, ERNIE 5.0, etc.) ([eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/2020956220694171718)).
* **Pushback on MoE ideology**: There’s a countercurrent arguing “MoE should die” in favor of unified latent spaces and flexible conditional computation; routing collapse and non-differentiable top‑k are called out as chronic issues ([teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020915555151040829)). Net: engineers like MoE for throughput but are looking for the next conditional compute paradigm that doesn’t bring MoE’s failure modes.
```

**China/open-model pipeline: GLM‑5 rumors, ERNIE 5.0 report, Kimi K2.5 in production, and model architecture diffusion**

```
* **GLM‑5 emerging details (rumor mill, but technically specific)**: Multiple tweets claim **GLM‑5 is “massive”**; one asserts **745B params** ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020840989947298156)), another claims it’s **2× GLM‑4.5 total params** with “DeepSeek sparse attention” for efficient long context ([eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/2020824645868630065)). There’s also mention of “GLM MoE DSA” landing in Transformers (suggesting architectural experimentation and downstream availability) ([xeophon](https://twitter.com/xeophon/status/2020815776890909052)).
* **Kimi K2.5 as a practical “implementation model”**: Qoder reports **SWE‑bench Verified 76.8%** for **Kimi K2.5** and positions it as cost-effective for implementation (“plan with Ultimate/Performance tier, implement with K2.5”) ([qoder\_ai\_ide](https://twitter.com/qoder_ai_ide/status/2020739503812387074)). Availability announcements across infra providers (e.g., Tinker API) reinforce that “deployment surface area” is part of the competition ([thinkymachines](https://twitter.com/thinkymachines/status/2020927620872011940)).
* **ERNIE 5.0 tech report**: The ERNIE 5.0 report landed; reactions suggest potentially interesting training details but skepticism about model quality and especially post-training (“inept at post-training”) ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020863398162972822), [teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020867552356778427)).
* **Embedding augmentation via n‑grams**: A technical sub-thread compares DeepSeek’s **Engram** to **SCONE**: direct backprop training of n‑gram embeddings and injection deeper in the network vs SCONE’s extraction and input-level usage ([gabriberton](https://twitter.com/gabriberton/status/2020612533502222459)).
```

**Agents in production: harnesses, observability, offline deep research, multi-agent reality checks, and infra lessons**

```
* **Agent harnesses as the real unlock**: Multiple tweets converge on the idea that the hard part is not “having an agent,” but building a **harness**: evaluation, tracing, correctness checks, and iterative debugging loops (SQL trace harness example [matsonj](https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/2020630608029036764); “agent observability” events and LangSmith tracing claims [LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2020920906772521274)).
* **Offline “deep research” trace generation**: OpenResearcher proposes a **fully offline** pipeline using **GPT‑OSS‑120B**, a local retriever, and a **10T-token corpus** to synthesize 100+ turn tool-use trajectories; SFT reportedly boosts **Nemotron‑3‑Nano‑30B‑A3B** on BrowseComp‑Plus from **20.8% → 54.8%** ([DongfuJiang](https://twitter.com/DongfuJiang/status/2020946549422031040)). This is a notable engineering direction: reproducible, rate-limit-free deep research traces.
* **Full-stack coding agents need execution-grounded testing**: FullStack-Agent introduces **Development-Oriented Testing** + **Repository Back-Translation**; results on “FullStack-Bench” show large backend/db gains vs baselines, and training Qwen3‑Coder‑30B on a few thousand trajectories yields further improvements ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020891961511809456)). This aligns with practitioners’ complaints that agents “ship mock endpoints.”
* **Multi-agent skepticism becoming formal**: A proposed metric Γ attempts to separate “true collaboration” from “just spending more compute,” highlighting communication explosion and degraded sequential performance ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2021013257348419670)). Related: Google research summary (via newsletter) claims multi-agent boosts parallelizable tasks but harms sequential ones, reinforcing the need for controlled comparisons ([dl\_weekly](https://twitter.com/dl_weekly/status/2020935994787143726)).
* **Serving + scaling lessons (vLLM, autoscaling)**: AI21 describes tuning vLLM throughput/latency and a key operational metric choice: autoscale on **queue depth**, not GPU utilization, emphasizing that 100% GPU ≠ overload ([AI21Labs](https://twitter.com/AI21Labs/status/2020787359285944746)).
* **Transformers’ “real win” framing**: A high-engagement mini-consensus argues transformers won not by marginal accuracy but by **architectural composability** across modalities (BLIP as the example) ([gabriberton](https://twitter.com/gabriberton/status/2020595051609698764); echoed by [koreansaas](https://twitter.com/koreansaas/status/2020631451461718375)).

## **/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap**

### **1. Qwen3-Coder-Next Model Discussions**

```
* **[Do not Let the “Coder” in Qwen3-Coder-Next Fool You! It’s the Smartest, General Purpose Model of its Size](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r0abpl/do_not_let_the_coder_in_qwen3codernext_fool_you/)** (Activity: 491): **The post discusses the capabilities of Qwen3-Coder-Next, a local LLM, highlighting its effectiveness as a general-purpose model despite its ‘coder’ label. The author compares it favorably to Gemini-3, noting its consistent performance and pragmatic problem-solving abilities, which make it suitable for stimulating conversations and practical advice. The model is praised for its ability to suggest relevant authors, books, or theories unprompted, offering a quality of experience comparable to Gemini-2.5/3, but with the advantage of local deployment, thus maintaining data privacy.** Commenters agree with the post’s assessment, noting that the ‘coder’ tag implies a model trained for structured, logical reasoning, which enhances its general-purpose utility. Some users are surprised by its versatility and recommend it over other local models, emphasizing its ability to mimic the tone of other models like GPT or Claude when configured with specific tools.
```

 + The ‘coder’ tag in Qwen3-Coder-Next is beneficial because models trained for coding tasks tend to exhibit more structured and literal reasoning, which enhances their performance in general conversations. This structured approach allows for clearer logic paths, avoiding the sycophancy often seen in chatbot-focused models, which tend to validate user input without critical analysis.
 + A user highlights the model’s ability to mimic the voice or tone of other models like GPT or Claude, depending on the tools provided. This flexibility is achieved by using specific call signatures and parameters, which can replicate Claude’s code with minimal overhead. This adaptability makes Qwen3-Coder-Next a versatile choice for both coding and general-purpose tasks.
 + Coder-trained models like Qwen3-Coder-Next are noted for their structured reasoning, which is advantageous for non-coding tasks as well. This structured approach helps in methodically breaking down problems rather than relying on pattern matching. Additionally, the model’s ability to challenge user input by suggesting alternative considerations is seen as a significant advantage over models that merely affirm user statements.
```
* **[Qwen3 Coder Next as first “usable” coding model < 60 GB for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/qwen3_coder_next_as_first_usable_coding_model_60/)** (Activity: 684): **Qwen3 Coder Next is highlighted as a significant improvement over previous models under 60 GB, such as GLM 4.5 Air and GPT OSS 20B, due to its speed, quality, and context size. It is an instruct MoE model that avoids internal thinking loops, offering faster token generation and reliable tool call handling. The model supports a context size of over** `100k`**, making it suitable for larger projects without excessive VRAM usage. The user runs it with** `24 GB VRAM` **and** `64 GB system RAM`**, achieving** `180 TPS` **prompt processing and** `30 TPS` **generation speed. The setup includes** `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1` **for increased TPS, and** `temp 0` **to prevent incorrect token generation.

```

 + Tooling UX and cost friction dominated: Cursor users said **Cursor Agent** lists Opus 4.6 but lacks a **Fast mode** toggle, while Windsurf shipped **Opus 4.6 (fast mode)** as a research preview claiming **up to 2.5× faster** with [promo pricing until Feb 16](https://x.com/windsurf/status/2020208878819115294).
```
* **Codex 5.3 Steals the Backend Crown**: Cursor users hyped **GPT-5.3 Codex** after Cursor announced it’s [available in Cursor](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2020921643145519249), with multiple reports that it’s more efficient and cheaper than Opus 4.6 for backend work.
```

 + In BASI Jailbreaking, people described jailbreaking **Codex 5.3** via **agents/Skills** rather than direct prompts (e.g., reverse engineering iOS apps), noting that on medium/high settings Codex’s reasoning *“will catch you trying to trick it”* if you let it reason.

**2. Agent Memory, RAG, and “Make It Verifiable” Architectures**

```
* **Wasserstein Memory Diet Claims ~40× RAM Savings**: A Perplexity/Nous community member open-sourced a **Go memory layer** that compresses redundant agent memories using **Optimal Transport (Wasserstein Distance)** during idle time, claiming **~40× lower RAM** than standard RAG, with code in [Remember-Me-AI](https://github.com/merchantmoh-debug/Remember-Me-AI) and a paired kernel in [moonlight-kernel](https://github.com/merchantmoh-debug/moonlight-kernel) under **Apache 2.0**.
```

 + They also claimed **Merkle proofs** prevent hallucinations and invited attempts to break the verification chain; related discussion connected this to a broader neuro-symbolic stack that synthesizes **46,000 lines of MoonBit (Wasm) code** for agent “reflexes” with Rust zero-copy arenas.
```
* **Agentic RAG Gets a Research-Backed Demo**: On Hugging Face, a builder demoed an **Agentic RAG** system grounded in **Self-RAG, Corrective RAG, Adaptive RAG, Tabular RAG** and multi-agent orchestration, sharing a [live demo + full code](https://lnkd.in/eX3YreMm).
```

 + The pitch emphasized *decision-awareness* and *self-correction* over documents + structured data, echoing other communities’ push to reduce the “re-explaining tax” via persistent memory patterns (Latent Space even pointed at [openclaw](https://github.com/steve-vincent/openclaw) as a reference implementation).
```
* **Containers as Guardrails: Dagger Pins Agents to Docker**: DSPy discussion elevated agent isolation as a practical safety primitive: a maintainer promoted [Dagger container-use](https://github.com/dagger/container-use) as an **isolation layer** that forces agents to run inside **Docker containers** and logs actions for auditability.
```

 + This landed alongside reports of **tool-calling friction** for RLM-style approaches (”*ReAct just works so much better*“) and rising concern about prompt-injection-like failures in agentic coding workflows.

**3. GPU Kernel Optimization, New Datasets, and Low-Precision Numerics**

```
* **KernelBot Opens the Data Spigot (and CuTe Wins the Meta)**: GPU MODE open-sourced datasets from the first **3 KernelBot competition problems** on Hugging Face as [GPUMODE/kernelbot-data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GPUMODE/kernelbot-data), explicitly so labs can train kernel-optimization models.
```

```
* **FP16 Winograd Stops Exploding via Rational Coefficients (NOVA)**: A new paper proposed stabilizing **FP16 Winograd transforms** by using ES-found **rational coefficients** instead of Cook–Toom points, reporting no usual accuracy hit and sharing results in [“Numerically Stable Winograd Transforms”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18453).
```

 + Follow-on discussion noted Winograd is the default for common **3×3 conv kernels** in cuDNN/MIOpen (not FFT), and HF’s #i-made-this thread echoed the same paper as a fix for low-precision Winograd kernel explosions.
```
* **Megakernels Hit ~1,000 tok/s and Blackwell Profilers Hang**: Kernel hackers reported **~1,000 tok/s** decoding from a persistent kernel in **qwen\_megakernel** (see commit and writeup linked from [decode optimization](https://blog.alpindale.net/posts/5090_decode_optimization/)), with notes about brittleness and plans for torch+cudagraph references.
```

 + Separately, GPU MODE users hit **Nsight Compute hangs** profiling **TMA + mbarrier** double-buffered kernels on **B200 (SM100)** with a shared minimal repro zip, highlighting how toolchain maturity is still a limiting factor for “peak Blackwell” optimization.

**4. Benchmarks, Evals, and “Proof I’m #1” Energy**

```
* **Veritas Claims +15% on SimpleQA Verified (and Wants Badges)**: Across OpenRouter/Nous/Hugging Face, a solo dev claimed **Veritas** beats the **“DeepMind Google Simple Q&A Verified”** benchmark by **+15%** over **Gemini 3.0**, publishing results at [dev.thelastrag.de/veritas\_benchmark](https://dev.thelastrag.de/veritas_benchmark) and sharing an attached paper PDF (HF also linked [PAPER\_Parametric\_Hubris\_2026.pdf](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897390720388825149/1470501876557418628/PAPER_Parametric_Hubris_2026.pdf?ex=698b8717&is=698a3597&hm=5ef44d235852555a1a314f004bc1df21544769f0c133d5c596a46390c84638db&)).
```

 + The thread even floated **benchmark titles/badges** to gamify results (with an example [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092850552192368710/1470475637725728790/image.png?ex=698b6ea8&is=698a1d28&hm=926b75d2631b49494d49cace975652cf5afbd58f3173db6393c0321f8d8a9f50)), while others pointed out extraordinary claims need clearer baselines and reproducibility details.
```
* **Agentrial Brings Pytest Vibes to Agent Regression Testing**: A Hugging Face builder released [agentrial](https://github.com/alepot55/agentrial), positioning it as “pytest for agents”: run **N trials**, compute **Wilson confidence intervals**, and use **Fisher exact tests** to catch regressions in CI/CD.
```

 + This resonated with broader Discord chatter about evals as the bottleneck for agentic SDLCs (including Yannick Kilcher’s community debating experiment tracking tools that support filtering/synthesis/graphs across many concurrent runs).

**5. Security & Platform Risk: KYC, Leaks, and “Your Prompt Is Just Text”**

```
* **Discord KYC Face-Scan Panic Meets Reality**: Multiple communities reacted to reports that Discord will require **biometric face scans/ID verification** globally starting next month (Latent Space linked a tweet: [disclosetv claim](https://x.com/disclosetv/status/2020875244223815801)), with BASI users worrying biased face recognition could lock out regions.
```

 + The thread veered into migration ideas (GPU MODE mentioned [Stoat](https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web) and [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat)) and gallows humor (a BASI user joked about using *“a hotdog from that sex cartoon”* for verification).
```
* **Z.ai Server Bug Report: “Internal Models Exposed”**: OpenRouter users reported serious **z.ai server vulnerabilities** allegedly enabling unauthorized access to internal models and sensitive data, saying outreach via Discord/Twitter failed to reach the team.
```

 + The discussion focused on escalation paths and responsible disclosure logistics rather than technical details, but the claim raised broader worries about provider-side security hygiene for model hosting.
```
* **Indirect Jailbreaks & Prompt-Injection Skepticism Collide**: BASI Jailbreaking users said an **OpenClaw** jailbreak attempt surfaced sensitive info and argued *indirect jailbreaks* are harder to defend because underlying platform vulnerabilities can be exploited regardless of the system prompt (OpenClaw repo also appears as a persistent-memory example: [steve-vincent/openclaw](https://github.com/steve-vincent/openclaw)).
```

 + In the same server, a red teamer questioned whether prompt injection is even a distinct threat because from an LLM’s perspective *“instructions, tools, user inputs, and safety prompts are all the same: text in > text out”*, while others argued systems still need hard boundaries (like container isolation) to make that distinction real.
