This is just a quick post to say that I've started a company.

It's called [Prime Radiant](https://primeradiant.com). (There's almost nothing on the website right now.)

We incorporated just before Christmas. My first new coworker started last week.

It should come as no surprise that we're doing AI stuff, although I'm not quite ready to talk about exactly which AI stuff we're doing.

We've got a ton of setup work to do. Over the next few days, I need to write a couple of job postings. Then I need to figure out how to hire folks in this crazy modern world where any job posting will attract an unending torrent of agentic job applications.

I expect that we'll continue to publish the sorts of tools and ideas that I've been writing about for the past year, mostly because there's a whole lot of infrastructure we need to be able to make and maintain the "product" we're building.

But right now, there's just a ton of stuff to do.
