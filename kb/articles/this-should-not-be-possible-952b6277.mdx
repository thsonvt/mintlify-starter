It might surprise some folks, but I'm incredibly cynical when it comes to AI and what is possible; yet I keep an open mind. That said, two weeks ago, when I was in SFO, I discovered another thing that should not be possible. Every time I find out something that works, which should not be possible, it pushes me further and further, making me think that we are already in post-AGI territory.

I was sitting next to a mate at a pub; it was pretty late, and we were just talking about LLM capabilities, riffing about what the modern version of [Falco](https://falco.org/?ref=ghuntley.com) or any of these tools in the DFIR space looks like when combined with an LLM.

You see, a couple of months ago, I'd been playing with eBPF and LLMs and discovered that LLMs do eBPF unusually well. So in the spirit of deliberate practice (see below), a laptop was brought out, and we SSH'd into a Linux machine.

The idea was simple.

Could we convert an eBPF trace to a fully functional application via [Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph)? So we started with a toy.
