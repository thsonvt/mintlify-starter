## Full Article

17th February 2026 Rodney v0.4.0. My Rodney CLI tool for browser automation attracted quite the flurry of PRs since I announced it last week. Here are the release notes for the just-released v0.4.0: Errors now use exit code 2, which means exit code 1 is just for for check failures. #15 New rodney assert command for running JavaScript tests, exit code 1 if they fail. #19 New directory-scoped sessions with --local/--global flags. #14 New reload --hard and clear-cache commands. #17 New rodney start --show option to make the browser window visible. Thanks, Antonio Cuni. #13 New rodney connect PORT command to debug an already-running Chrome instance. Thanks, Peter Fraenkel. #12 New RODNEY_HOME environment variable to support custom state directories. Thanks, Senko Rašić. #11 New --insecure flag to ignore certificate errors. Thanks, Jakub Zgoliński. #10 Windows support: avoid Setsid on Windows via build-tag helpers. Thanks, adm1neca. #18 Tests now run on windows-latest and macos-latest in addition to Linux. I've been using Showboat to create demos of new features - here those are for rodney assert, rodney reload --hard, rodney exit codes, and rodney start --local. The rodney assert command is pretty neat: you can now Rodney to test a web app through multiple steps in a shell script that looks something like this (adapted from the README): #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail FAIL=0 check() &#123; if ! "$@"; then echo "FAIL: $*" FAIL=1 fi &#125; rodney start rodney open "https://example.com" rodney waitstable # Assert elements exist check rodney exists "h1" # Assert key elements are visible check rodney visible "h1" check rodney visible "#main-content" # Assert JS expressions check rodney assert 'document.title' 'Example Domain' check rodney assert 'document.querySelectorAll("p").length' '2' # Assert accessibility requirements check rodney ax-find --role navigation rodney stop if [ "$FAIL" -ne 0 ]; then echo "Some checks failed" exit 1 fi echo "All checks passed"
