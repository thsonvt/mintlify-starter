It’s getting a little hard to say interesting things with all the round robin minor version updates of frontier models every week, but Gemini 3.1 Pro seems like a decent enough advance to catch up, and in some cases, supercede, the fellow frontier models (this is surely the reason that 3.1 -had- to be released, because with 5.3 and 4.6 things were seriously falling behind for Google[1](#footnote-1))

# **AI Twitter Recap**

## **Top Story: Gemini 3.1 release facts and reactions/opinions**

Google shipped **Gemini 3.1 Pro** (generally described as a **Preview** for developers) and rolled it out across the **Gemini app**, **NotebookLM**, **Gemini API / AI Studio**, and **Vertex AI**, positioning it as the “core intelligence” from **Gemini 3 Deep Think** scaled down for practical product use. The announcement emphasized a big reasoning jump—especially **ARC-AGI-2 = 77.1%**—plus strong coding and agentic-tool benchmarks (e.g., **SWE-Bench Verified = 80.6%**) and improved hallucination behavior. Independent leaderboards and evaluators largely corroborated top-tier performance and strong cost/intelligence positioning, while reaction threads highlighted (a) excitement about practical gains (SVG/web/UI/code quality, agentic use cases), (b) skepticism about benchmark-targeting and “eval tweeting,” (c) concerns around **GDPval** (real-world agentic tasks) not leading despite other SOTA scores, and (d) rollout friction: users finding some products (Gemini CLI / Code Assist / Antigravity) unavailable or inconsistently updated at launch.
