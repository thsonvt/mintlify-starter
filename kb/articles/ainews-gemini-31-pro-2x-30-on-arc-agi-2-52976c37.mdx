The announcement emphasized a big reasoning jumpespecially ARC-AGI-2 = 77.1%plus strong coding and agentic-tool benchmarks (e.g., SWE-Bench Verified = 80.6%) and improved hallucination behavior. Independent leaderboards and evaluators largely corroborated top-tier performance and strong cost/intelligence positioning, while reaction threads highlighted (a) excitement about practical gains (SVG/web/UI/code quality, agentic use cases), (b) skepticism about benchmark-targeting and eval tweeting, (c) concerns around GDPval (real-world agentic tasks) not leading despite other SOTA scores, and (d) rollout friction: users finding some products (Gemini CLI / Code Assist / Antigravity) unavailable or inconsistently updated at launch.Facts vs. opinions Read more
