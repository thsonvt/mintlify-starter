# 💥 Top threads this week
```

## 1. What title to use on my resume

> **I’m pivoting from 10+ years of software engineering into product management. At my consulting business, I’ve been doing PM work (discovery, prioritization, shipping products with measurable outcomes) but never with the official title.**
>
> **For my resume header, I’m torn between:**
>
> **1. Product Engineer—feels honest, signals I can build and think product 
> 2. Product Manager—but I haven’t held the title formally 
> 3.** **Associate Product Manager—honest about being new to PM, but weird next to “10+ years experience”**
>
> **What would you put? What reads best to hiring managers? [↗️](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/archives/C091QLVDRS7/p1769965822426209)**
>
> **—[Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvnvw/)**

**Yoshi Komada:** Agree on avoiding the APM title. If it’s your own consulting business and you’re doing the work, why not use ‘product manager’? FYI, in some larger tech companies ‘product engineer’ means an engineer who works on user-facing products (as opposed to, e.g., infra) and does not mean PM.

**Scott:** Resume for some context: [J\_Scott\_Chapman\_2026.pdf](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/files/U01A9BYK2TB/F0ACNGACGFK/j_scott_chapman_2026.pdf?origin_team=T013K620LTW&origin_channel=C091QLVDRS7)

```
[@Yoshi Komada](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U06CZ9A5D35), thank you for the feedback. I was avoiding using product manager as my overall title because I haven’t necessarily done all of the documentation/pageantry to communicate with other team members, because it was just me. I didn’t make a whole Asana project and assign myself tasks and make milestones and all that because it was just going to be me doing the work as well. So I was trying to avoid being misleading, or at least avoid creating an environment in which hiring managers would feel like I was being misleading.
```

**[Miroslav Pavelek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslavpavelek/):** I would go for “PM” and I would rename your last job as “Lead Product Engineer.”

**[Joshua Herzig-Marx](https://joshua.herzig-marx.com/):** If you’re applying for product management jobs and you can honestly call what you were doing product management, then absolutely give yourself the product management title. Your resume is supposed to be helpful to a hiring manager in figuring out who you are. And companies are (generically) terrible at naming things. So if taking the PM title (Lead PM/technical lead isn’t bad) clarifies, great! And if it’s your own consulting business, then who’s going to disagree?

**roi lavan:** I’d change to full-stack engineer turned product. It doesn’t mean that you have to hold the title officially, it means that you did the work. Also, even though in your consulting project you’re specifying results, in the first section you are being a bit too generic, IMHO. “Measure product outcomes using analytics (Mixpanel) and iterate based on data to achieve measurable improvements”—this is literally the job… so either talk about what the improvements were or skip this section, IMHO.

**Scott:** [@roi lavan](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0A551BM6BE), are you saying take that mention out of the consulting overview section or just below it in the project details where I explained what the steps were, or both?

**[Miroslav Pavelek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslavpavelek/):** [@Scott](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0ABV6Z3E72), yeah, the latest job. Also naming it “Lead PM/technical lead” sounds good.

**roi lavan:** [@Scott](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0ABV6Z3E72), the former, consulting overview (all 3 bullet points are the same concept of explaining what PMs do).

**Scott:** [@roi lavan](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0A551BM6BE), I see. I’m new to this, so please excuse my ignorance. Why is it bad that I’m explaining that I did the things that product managers do? I know it’s the point of a resume to demonstrate that you did the things that ATS or hiring managers are looking for, so I’m probably misunderstanding what you’re saying.

**[Miroslav Pavelek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslavpavelek/):** [@Scott](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0ABV6Z3E72), focus on the impact/outcome, not on the process.

**roi lavan:** It’s a matter of taste. To me, CV is where you’re supposed to demonstrate your impact in various ways so that hiring managers can extrapolate whether you could help them solve their business problems. It’s supposed to be short and concrete so that hiring managers read through and understand the basics. “Wasting” room for generic descriptions IMHO won’t do you any good in the best case, and hurt you in the worst case (because it is noise that prevents hiring managers from reading the good stuff).

**[Joshua Herzig-Marx](https://joshua.herzig-marx.com/):** The consistent advice is to demonstrate impact on your resume—but let’s be real: 80%+ of your impact is going to be driven by company strategy—maybe even more if you’re in a consultancy. Try to make it easy for the hiring manager or resume screener to say, “I understand what they did, I understand what made them successful, and that aligns with what they’ll be doing in our org.”

All that said, the folks who are getting hired fastest are the ones who have a strong advocate within the organization where they’re interviewing—so don’t focus so much on your resume that you skip the networking part!

**Scott:** I probably have a pretty terrible bias since I’ve worked on applicant tracking systems before. Part of my resume is aimed at the computers, and then I also try to make it skimmable for humans. For instance, when you use the Quick Apply with LinkedIn, I was told the hiring manager only receives the titles from your previous experiences. So I was trying to home in on that first. Thank you, everyone, for all the insights. You gave me a lot of good stuff to work with.

**roi lavan:** I used to co-lead the product team at ZipRecruiter. Your best shot at getting hired is referrals and not applying on LinkedIn, even if you pass the bots. The average recruiter spends 6 seconds on your resume to determine if you’re worth contacting. Any noise or overload in the resume would play against you.

**Anonymous:** [@Scott](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0ABV6Z3E72), I honestly don’t think you see what you’re sitting on. Product + Engineering + Design(?). That is the trifecta!!! I think you need to go feel good about yourself and have a listen [here](https://youtu.be/87Pm0SGTtN8). Your resume is an advert for you and you’re the product. That’s it. There’s lots of product stuff in there, but you make it hard to find. Even if you just bolded the words, it would be easier to go “Oh, lots of product here, and look, he can blend.” And perhaps “He’d even be an asset in helping us AI up our product workflows because he can stand on both sides end-to-end.” I’m assuming given your engineering part you’re strong on context management (AI). Transferable entirely. Anyhow, I’m excited for you. I made a conversation in Claude. I think it may be helpful, maybe a couple of ideas. I’ll DM it to you. You may find [this interesting to watch too](https://youtu.be/0teZqotpqT8). I like the channel.

## 2. Mistakes when hiring a growth PM

> **I’m looking to make my first dedicated growth PM hire at Boldin. What’s the most common mistake you’ve seen companies make when hiring their first growth PM? [We’re a retirement planning app](https://www.boldin.com/). [↗️](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/archives/C017BBL1UN8/p1770149505132679)**
>
> **—Travis Bjorklund**

**[Călin](https://contrast.studio):** I haven’t hired, but I saw mistakes made by my clients (seed>series B companies). One from a design perspective is not engaging UX enough, especially if growth is product-led. Growth PMs need ample design and eng support.

**Ilya Subkhankulov:** I’ve seen:

```
* Growth team either overlapping, conflicting or misaligned with the Marketing team. Whichever is closest to CEO has more authority.
* Growth team with minimal design/eng resources/support.
* Perception of poor ROI by CFO.
```

**alexa:** I’ve seen—

```
* Over-indexing on SQL skills: a non-optimal SQL query is not going to impact the effectiveness of the PM in that role at all.
* Hiring an SME into the role when consumer onboarding is convincing an average individual they need the product.
```

**Anuj Adhiya:** Not knowing what your biggest vector for growth is going to be. For example, product-led growth or paid ads might be what you need, and as a result not hiring somebody who would be a force multiplier for that vector you need for the next stage of growth.

**Travis Bjorklund:** @Ilya Subkhankulov, those are good, thank you.

@alexa, interesting—what do you mean about hiring a SME?

**alexa:** Conflating domain expertise (SME in tax laws) with growth skills (convincing people to buy the product). A growth PM would ideally have experience in fintech products to understand the domain enough and know that half the battle is persuading legal. When teams hire an actual SME to run growth, it results in a risk-averse and exact experience. Those traits are great for compliance, but for growth every field becomes “required,” with a 30-inch legalese page and 9 checkboxes. And the consumer app suddenly ends up with B2B onboarding or mimics a F500 bank experience.

**Travis Bjorklund:** Yeah, that’s a really good one—thank you

## 3. Using AI to speed up bug reporting

> **Apropos of the “everyone codes really fast now” discussion, I’ve noticed that we can code really fast but our process for capturing/reporting bugs is now painfully slow. Anyone have any good tips for using AI tools to log feedback faster? I have a prototype that my team built that needs a lot of kinks worked out, but documenting what I want them to do is not very efficient.**
>
> **Things I’ve tried: Using ChatGPT Atlas, but it couldn’t understand how to work across the app in one tab and Jira in another. Turning a session recording from PostHog into a bug—turns out our PostHog setup was broken; going to try this again after I get it fixed. [↗️](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/archives/C017V1FPCQY/p1770236031990839)**

**[Joshua Herzig-Marx](https://joshua.herzig-marx.com/):** What kind of bugs—I assume you mean free-range, artisanal, human-caught bugs? I screenshot the problem and maybe the console and tell AI to figure it out.

**OP:** Mostly bugs of the “I click this button and something weird happens” variety. I have been screenshotting and trying to write up enough detail to be useful, but I really just want to be able to point at things and make bug tickets appear.

**[Joshua Herzig-Marx](https://joshua.herzig-marx.com/):** Try less detail! Maybe screenshot + an automation (if you’re on a Mac—I’m not) and maybe a little voice capture.

**OP:** Yeah, trying to figure out a useful automation that gets the right info to the right place without me copy/pasting things.

**Marc Dupuis ([Fabi.ai](http://fabi.ai)):** My experience is that you have two types of teams: Team A: Needs bugs filed in a backlog and they need to be pushed and prodded to prioritize them and fix them. Team B: You just ping them on Slack with a screenshot or recording and they take ownership and just fix it. With AI, given the right culture, this is what I’ve come to expect. I have a saying: If prioritizing a bug is taking longer than it would to fix it, we’re doing something wrong. And if a bug does get reported and doesn’t get fixed and you forget about it, it probably didn’t matter. What I’m sharing here kind of breaks down at a certain scale, but…

**[Neal Oliver](http://nealoliver.com):** I have seen setups where Claude lives in Slack and they just at-Claude to report the bug and Claude fixes it and submits a PR. I have not set this up myself, but it seems possible (or at least AI influencers make it seem possible)...

**OP:** I’d like to get to Team B, but we’re in a bit of a transition phase.

**[Huy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/htieu/):** This is exactly what we are doing in our team, like [@Neal Oliver](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U09UACKAG0N) said, and it’s me who will at-Claude first (because I’m the one who has the most tokens available). Make a PR, then dev will review it later.

Another setup I have is: store all bug screenshot in a folder, connect Claude Code to that folder and ask it to write bug report and push to Jira using Atlassian MCP.

**Chris Timms:** I’ve made engineering teams accountable for the whole bug resolution workflow. What that’s enabled them to do is automate maybe 80% of the process, from reporting to investigation to communicating the severity. For minor bugs it will also resolve them now, and we are working on building it out to handle more complex bugs (this is hard, because it’s a brownfield 15-year-old codebase with... shall we say, customisations?). But it’s working great within its scope—it also allows us to enforce triage guidance, and it surfaces more often when a CS team over- or under-prioritises bugs frequently.

**OP:** [@Huy](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0A7EC8A9L5), can Claude Code make sense of your screenshots enough to write clear bug reports? Does it need access to the source code to do that or can it get the info it needs from the images?

**[Joshua Herzig-Marx](https://joshua.herzig-marx.com/):** (Not Huy, but I’ve found Claude Code—and other similar tools like Cursor or Antigravity—needs to have access to the source code in order to understand what’s happening and what’s supposed to happen, though I suppose it’s possible that you could give it enough context in other ways—I’ve just been using source code as context. Perhaps if you have sufficient design docs, PRDs, test plans, etc.).

**OP:** I have the source code, so that’s doable.

**[Joshua Herzig-Marx](https://joshua.herzig-marx.com/):** Claude Code will analyze it first, and that should help it figure out what it needs to be looking at. You may also want to add an explicit “debug from screenshot” skill.

**Anonymous:** Claude Code can take screenshots with Playwright MCP—I know you said you want to document. But I’m going to drop these screenshots here so you can actually see what’s possible, even though it doesn’t directly answer your question.

Me, I’d go down this route (even if your developers don’t want to add automated end to end tests). You can still get Claude Code to screenshot and make those “bug reports” for you... if that’s what you want to do. You’d need help from your developers to get into your repo to use Claude Code and set up a test user. You can even make a template for Claude Code to use to “report the bug” and add helpful context for the developers. Maybe they just say to Claude Code “action this bug report.”

([Pics are attached in reverse order](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/archives/C017V1FPCQY/p1770300102352029?thread_ts=1770236031.990839&cid=C017V1FPCQY)—start from right to left) Instead of you writing a test, you tell Claude Code to write your bug report.

But me, I’d write the failing test. And that goes in the bug report with a link to your throwaway branch that contains the end-to-end failing test Claude Code wrote. Or just a regular bug report.

**[Huy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/htieu/):** When you take a screenshot, make sure you annotate on it what’s wrong, and the agent is good enough to know what’s wrong.

**OP:** This is awesome, thanks for sharing. We are using Playwright for at least some of our testing. I need to get my team a little more hands-on with it.

**[Huy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/htieu/):** Well, trying *not* to promote my product, but when we have our Scout agent to report issues/bug, it’s more on networklog, console logs, DOM object, etc. But we will need to adjust it a bit. Taking screenshots and analyze screenshots to understand what’s wrong is another story.

**Anonymous:** Oh good, I’m glad it was useful, I never quite know. It really is not difficult. I thought it would be—but not.

**Huy:** I would say for the smaller models (like we did, to save cost and prioritize speed), it’s so-so, but if you have a better model, it works really well.

**Anonymous:** I don’t know if it will be useful to you or your devs—it’s a tiny little app (basically login and mock data—really not a lot—but enough for me to learn what I needed. I’m moving onto making CLIs for Claude Code rather than apps). The tests that CC wrote using this method are in the “e2e” directory. You’ll see Playwright MCP in file “.mcp.json”. And there’s Playwright config too (see the table in the README. The repo is [here](https://github.com/michellepace/devflow)—I’m 100% sure a professional engineer can do it better. It’s just my learning project. The directories and files you see are what you would see in your IDE if you cloned the repo and opened it up. Then run “npm run dev” in the terminal, and away you go with Claude Code and Playwright. (Maybe a bit of setup at the bottom of the readme.)

## 4. Launching a solo consulting practice

> **Q: Do companies bring in individual third-party consultants,** ***not*** **big consultancies, specifically to diagnose what’s breaking performance across a product or funnel—and fix the highest-leverage bottleneck (UX, messaging, or strategy)? I see a lot of value in having another set of eyes outside of the organisation to diagnose what’s really going on. I want to see if this would be a valuable offer for some people.**

> **I’m an ex-FAANG UX Content Strategist and AI Product Manager. My strength is spotting the bottleneck in an end-to-end journey that’s killing engagement or outcomes and tracing it back to the larger system and why these kind of problems keep cropping up. Basically, I do a mix of product strategy and UX strategy, with the extra advantage that I have a background in content across sales, marketing, and product.**

**Thomas Underhill:** A former startup that I worked at had someone sort of doing pieces of this (the GTM side) as a consultant. We paid them a lot of money and, if I’m being frank, they weren’t effective, as there were far deeper cracks in the organization’s foundation. Anyhow, I have done other portions of this (the AI, product, and engineering assessments—coming in and either making recommendations or making the difficult decisions myself). I struggled (and still struggle) to get enough real leads to spend much time on it. If you decide to go this route, I recommend partnering with a big or niche consultancy.

**Alexandra C. MacArthur:** [@Thomas Underhill](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U095QLSDY84) Thank you so much for this. May I ask how you’re getting clients? LinkedIn posts, outreach? The main success story I’ve heard is people who were really established having referrals form people they’ve worked with in the past.

**Thomas Underhill:** I haven’t had any big engagements, but I have had some small engagements spawn from GLG expert calls. My last big engagement was a big consulting firm finding me online and started with something small that expanded. My network hasn’t been helpful, unfortunately. My social media presence is minimal because I was previously working in an industry where I was effectively banned from posting. It also required that I disconnect from a lot of my existing LinkedIn connections, which dropped my network from like 1,500 people to around 300. I’m having to rebuild it now that I’ve chosen to exit that industry and the restrictions it has. I think for most people, networking and social media is how you get engagements.

**Ryan Moser:** This isn’t impossible, but it’s an extremely, extremely tough ask. The MBBs of the world offer safety; hiring McKinsey is always defensible to the board. People care much more about their own safety than about what the consultancy delivers. The only times when a company will bring in an individual third-party consultant is when the executives are not driven by fear. This is the only circumstance where a better outcome for the business might be of interest. Absent this, the quality of the work and the outcomes for the business are an afterthought at best.

**Alexandra C. MacArthur:** [@Ryan Moser](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/team/U0A7FPJTL22), that is such an interesting perspective and makes so much sense!
