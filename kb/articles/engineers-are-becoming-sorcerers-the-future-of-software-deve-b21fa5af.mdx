**Sherwin Wu** leads engineering for OpenAI’s API platform, where roughly 95% of engineers use Codex, often working with fleets of 10 to 20 parallel AI agents.

**Listen on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/B26CwKm5C1k), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3EPDh5GqC9PEdyQBEpmdrQ), and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/engineers-are-becoming-sorcerers-the-future-of/id1627920305?i=1000749436380)**

### We discuss:

1. What OpenAI did to cut code review times from 10-15 minutes to 2-3 minutes
2. How AI is changing the role of managers
3. Why the productivity gap between AI power users and everyone else is widening
4. Why “models will eat your scaffolding for breakfast”
5. Why the next 12 to 24 months are a rare window where engineers can leap ahead before the role fully transforms

## My biggest takeaways from this conversation:

1. **AI is writing virtually all code at OpenAI.** 95% of the engineers use Codex, and engineers who embrace these tools open 70% more pull requests than their peers, and that gap is widening over time.
2. **The role of a software engineer is shifting from writing code to managing fleets of AI agents.** Many engineers now run 10 to 20 parallel Codex threads, steering and reviewing rather than writing code themselves.
3. **The average PR code review time has dropped from 10-15 minutes per PR to 2-3 minutes.** Every pull request at OpenAI is now reviewed by Codex before human eyes see it, and Codex surfaces suggestions and catches issues up front. This allows engineers to focus on more creative and strategic work while dramatically increasing productivity.
4. **The models will eat your scaffolding for breakfast.** When building AI products, don’t optimize for today’s model capabilities. The field is evolving so rapidly that the scaffolding (vector stores, agent frameworks, etc.) that seems essential today may be obsolete tomorrow as models improve.
5. **Build for where the models are going, not where they are today.** The most successful AI startups build products that work at 80% capability now, knowing the next model release will push them over the line.
6. **Top performers become disproportionately more productive with AI tools.** AI tools amplify the productivity of high-agency individuals, so the gap between top performers and everyone else is widening. The ROI on unblocking and empowering your best people compounds faster than ever in an AI-augmented environment.
7. **Most enterprise AI deployments have negative ROI because they’re top-down mandates without bottom-up adoption.** Success requires both executive buy-in and grassroots enthusiasm. Sherwin recommends creating a “tiger team” of technically-minded enthusiasts (often not engineers) who can explore capabilities, apply AI to specific workflows, and create excitement throughout the organization.
8. **The one-person billion-dollar startup is coming, but with unexpected second-order effects.** As AI makes individuals more productive, we’ll see not just billion-dollar solo founders but an explosion of small businesses: hundreds of $100M startups and tens of thousands of $10M startups. This will transform the startup ecosystem and venture capital landscape.
9. **Business process automation is an underrated AI opportunity.** While Silicon Valley focuses on knowledge work, most of the economy runs on repeatable business processes with standard operating procedures. There’s massive potential to apply AI to these workflows, which are often overlooked by the tech community.
10. **The next two to three years will be the most exciting in tech.** After a relatively quiet period from 2015 to 2020, we’re now in an unprecedented era of innovation. Sherwin encourages everyone to engage with AI tools and not take this moment for granted, as the pace of change will eventually slow.
11. **AI models will soon handle multi-hour tasks coherently.** Today’s models are optimized for tasks that take minutes, but within 12 to 18 months we’ll see models that can work on complex tasks for upward of six hours. This will enable entirely new categories of products and workflows.
12. **Audio is the next frontier for multimodal AI.** While coding and text get most of the attention, audio is hugely underrated in business settings. Improvements in speech-to-speech models over the next 6 to 12 months will unlock significant new capabilities for business communication and operations.
