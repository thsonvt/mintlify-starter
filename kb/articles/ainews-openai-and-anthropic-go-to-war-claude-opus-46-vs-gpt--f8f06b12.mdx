If you think the simultaneous release of [Claude Opus 4.6](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46902223) and [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46902638) is sheer coincidence, you’re not sufficiently appreciating the intensity of the competition between the two leading coding model labs in the world right now. It has never been as clear from:

```
* in **Consumer**, [the dueling Superbowl Ad campaigns](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think) (and [subsequent defense from sama](https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?s=20))
* in the **Enterprise**, [Anthropic releasing knowledge work plugins](https://www.reworked.co/collaboration-productivity/anthropic-adds-plugins-to-claude-cowork/) vs OpenAI launching [Frontier](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/), an enterprise-scale agents platform for knowledge work (with a [~50% collapse in SaaS stocks as collateral damage](https://x.com/awealthofcs/status/2018337784113549510?s=46))
* to the synced **Coding** launches today.
```

From a pure PR point of view, Anthropic won the day via [distributed denial of developer attention](https://x.com/swyx/status/2019545404879303059?s=20) across their [1m context](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2019492635292152271?s=46) and [new custom compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction) and [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) and [effort](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) and [Claude Code agent teams](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46902368) and Claude in [Powerpoint](https://claude.com/claude-in-powerpoint)/[Excel](https://claude.com/claude-in-excel) and [500 zero-days](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/) and [C compiler task](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2019496582698397945?s=20) and use of [mechinterp](https://x.com/adamrpearce/status/2019482478566686955) and [ai consciousness callouts](https://x.com/aisafetymemes/status/2019477474120237318?s=46) and [$50 promos](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46904569), whereas OpenAI won on most benchmarks with 25% higher speed with higher token efficiency and touted more web development skills, but it’s likely that all first day third party reactions are either biased or superficial. [Here](https://x.com/neilsuperduper/status/2019486017703547309?s=20) is Opus making visual comparisons of the different announcements:

```

Both are minor version bumps, which will set the stage for Claude 5 and GPT 6 battles this summer.

**Your move, GDM and SpaceXai.**

# **AI Twitter Recap**
```

**Top tweets (by engagement)**

```
* **Frontier lab engineering**: Anthropic’s post on using agent teams + Opus 4.6 to build a **clean-room C compiler** that boots Linux drew major attention ([tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2019496582698397945)).
* **OpenAI release**: **GPT-5.3-Codex** launch (and Codex product updates) landed as the biggest pure-AI product event ([tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2019474152743223477)).
```

---

**OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex + “Frontier” agent platform (performance, efficiency, infra co-design)**

```
* **GPT-5.3-Codex shipped in Codex**: OpenAI announced **GPT-5.3-Codex now available in Codex** (“You can just build things”) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2019474152743223477)) and framed it as advancing **frontier coding + professional knowledge** in one model ([tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2019474328577036648)).
```

 + Community reaction highlighted that **token efficiency + inference speed** may be the most strategically important delta vs prior generations ([tweet](https://twitter.com/polynoamial/status/2019476535044948419)), with one benchmark claim: **TerminalBench 2 = 65.4%** and a head-to-head “demolished Opus 4.6” narrative circulating immediately after launch ([tweet](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019477301587567063)).
 + Reported efficiency improvements: **2.09× fewer tokens** vs GPT-5.2-Codex-xhigh on **SWE-Bench-Pro**, and together with ~**40%** speedup implies **2.93× faster** at ~**+1%** score ([tweet](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019492593709772815)). This theme was echoed by practitioners as a sign that 2026 is no longer assuming “infinite budget compute” ([tweet](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/2019520654341464450)).
```
* **Hardware/software co-design for GB200**: A notable systems angle: OpenAI engineers describe the model as “designed for **GB200-NVL72**” and mention **ISA nitpicking**, rack sims, and tailoring architecture to the system ([tweet](https://twitter.com/trevorycai/status/2019482450855096440)). Separate “fruits of long-term collaboration with NVIDIA” posts reinforce that **model gains are arriving with platform-specific optimization** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2019511824232903079)).
* **OpenAI Frontier (agents platform)**: OpenAI’s “Frontier” is positioned as a platform to build/deploy/manage agents with **business context, execution environments (tools/code), learning-on-the-job, and identity/permissions** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/snsf/status/2019473067723071708)). A separate report quotes Fidji Simo emphasizing partnering with an ecosystem rather than building everything internally ([tweet](https://twitter.com/kate_rouch/status/2019444695051706817)).
* **Internal adoption playbook for agentic software dev**: A detailed post lays out OpenAI’s operational push: by March 31, for technical tasks the “tool of first resort” should be an **agent**, with team processes like **AGENTS.md**, “skills” libraries, tool inventories exposed via **CLI/MCP**, agent-first codebases, and “say no to slop” review/accountability norms ([tweet](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2019566641491963946)). This is one of the clearer public examples of how a frontier lab is trying to industrialize “agent trajectories → mergeable code.”
* **Developer ecosystem activation**: Codex hackathon and ongoing builder showcases amplify “ship velocity” positioning ([tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2019513755621843450), [tweet](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2019581296083980412)). There’s also active curiosity about computer-use parity stacks (e.g., OSWorld-Verified claims, agent browser vs Chrome MCP APIs) and a request for OpenAI to benchmark and recommend the “right” harness ([tweet](https://twitter.com/corbtt/status/2019535402059854280), [tweet](https://twitter.com/corbtt/status/2019554771666162087)).

**Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6: agentic coding, long-context, and benchmarking “noise”**

```
* **Autonomous C compiler as a forcing function for “agent teams”**: Anthropic reports assigning Opus 4.6 agent teams to build a **C compiler**, then “mostly walking away”; after ~2 weeks it worked on the Linux kernel ([tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2019496582698397945)). A widely-shared excerpt claims: “clean-room” (no internet), ~**100K lines**, boots **Linux 6.9** on x86/ARM/RISC‑V, compiles major projects (QEMU/FFmpeg/SQLite/postgres/redis), and hits **~99%** on several test suites incl. **GCC torture tests**, plus the Doom litmus test ([tweet](https://twitter.com/__alpoge__/status/2019535987085570512)).
```

 + Engineers also questioned what “clean-room” should mean when the generator model was trained on broad internet corpora ([tweet](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2019542856638324759)), and others argued parts of the evaluation are “cheating” because compilation against GCC makes progress more verifiable ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/2019578717392236701)).
```
* **Benchmarking reliability & infra noise**: Anthropic published a second engineering post quantifying that **infrastructure configuration** can swing agentic coding benchmark results by **multiple percentage points**, sometimes larger than leaderboard gaps ([tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2019501512200974686)). This lands in the middle of a community debate about inconsistent benchmark choices and limited overlap (often only **TerminalBench 2.0**) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/itsclivetime/status/2019486668684738753)).
* **Distribution + product hooks**: Opus 4.6 availability expanded quickly—e.g. **Windsurf** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/windsurf/status/2019480496778989828)), **Replit Agent 3** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/pirroh/status/2019537942717559237)), **Cline** integration emphasizing CLI autonomous mode ([tweet](https://twitter.com/cline/status/2019550290341716106)). There’s also an incentive: many Claude Code users can claim **$50 credit** in the usage dashboard ([tweet](https://twitter.com/theo/status/2019559922523074765)).
* **Claims about uplift and limits**: A system-card line circulating claims staff-estimated productivity uplift **30%–700%** (mean **152%**, median **100%**) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019493327075254338)). Yet internal staff reportedly do **not** see Opus 4.6 as a near-term “drop-in replacement for entry-level researchers” within 3 months, even with scaffolding ([tweet](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019494684289048989); related discussion [tweet](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/2019499856658927681)).
* **Model positioning and “sandbagging” speculation**: Some observers suggested Opus 4.6’s gains might come from **longer thinking** rather than a larger base model, with speculation it might be “Sonnet-ish” but with higher reasoning token budget (not confirmed) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/mikeknoop/status/2019571346012008903); skeptical reaction [tweet](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019572489349931342)). Separate chatter referenced “Sonnet 5 leaks” and sandbagging theories ([tweet](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019499166582399075)).
* **Leaderboards**: Vals AI claims **Opus 4.6 #1 on the Vals Index** and SOTA on several agentic benchmarks (FinanceAgent/ProofBench/TaxEval/SWE-Bench) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/ValsAI/status/2019471561539874938)), while the broader ecosystem debated which benchmarks matter and how to compare.

**New research: routing/coordination for agents, multi-agent efficiency, and “harnesses”**

```
* **SALE (Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency)**: Meta Superintelligence Labs research proposes an auction-like router: candidate agents submit short **strategic plans**, peer-judged for value, and cost-estimated; the “best cost-value” wins. It reports **+3.5 pass@1** on deep-search while cutting cost **35%**, and **+2.7 pass@1** on coding at **25%** lower cost, with **53%** reduced reliance on the largest agent ([tweet](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2019414476244807892); paper link in tweet). This is a concrete alternative to classifiers/FrugalGPT-style cascades under rising task complexity.
* **Agent Primitives (latent MAS building blocks)**: A proposed decomposition of multi-agent systems into reusable primitives—**Review**, **Voting/Selection**, **Planning/Execution**—where agents communicate via **KV-cache** instead of natural language to reduce degradation and overhead. Reported: **12.0–16.5%** average accuracy gains over single-agent baselines across 8 benchmarks, and a large GPQA-Diamond jump (**53.2%** vs **33.6–40.2%** prior methods), with **3–4×** lower token/latency than text-based MAS (but 1.3–1.6× overhead vs single-agent) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/dair_ai/status/2019416738484613184); paper link in tweet).
* **“Teams hold experts back”**: Work arguing fixed workflows/roles can cap expert performance as tasks scale, motivating adaptive workflow synthesis ([tweet](https://twitter.com/aneeshpappu/status/2019447577825976332)).
* **Tooling shift: frameworks → harnesses**: Multiple threads emphasized that the LLM is “just the engine”; reliability comes from a **strict harness** that enforces planning/memory/verification loops, plus patterns like sub-agent spawning to preserve manager context ([tweet](https://twitter.com/MeredithCheng22/status/2019511897373233647)) and Kenton Varda’s observation that “low-hanging fruit” in harnesses is producing wins everywhere ([tweet](https://twitter.com/KentonVarda/status/2019499382433784121)).
* **Parallel agents in IDE/CLI**: GitHub Copilot CLI introduced **“Fleets”**—dispatch parallel subagents with a session **SQLite DB** to track dependency-aware tasks/TODOs ([tweet](https://twitter.com/_Evan_Boyle/status/2019497961777172488)). VS Code positioned itself as a “home for multi-agent development” managing local/background/cloud agents, including Claude/Codex, under Copilot subscription ([tweet](https://twitter.com/code/status/2019547839857148085)). VS Code Insiders adds agent steering and message queueing ([tweet](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2019575107681993014)).

**Training & efficiency research: tiny fine-tuning, RL objectives, continual learning, privacy, long context**

```
* **TinyLoRA: “Learning to Reason in 13 Parameters”**: A PhD capstone claims a fine-tuning approach where (with TinyLoRA + RL) a 7B Qwen model improved **GSM8K 76% → 91%** using only **13 trainable parameters** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/2019251724020772933)). If reproducible, this is a striking data point for “extreme low-DOF” adaptation for reasoning.
* **Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL)**: Proposes an objective interpolating between REINFORCE and maximum likelihood; the algorithm is described as a near “one-line change” (normalize advantage by mean reward). Claims: better sample efficiency, Pareto-dominates GRPO on reasoning, better scaling dynamics (larger gradients on harder problems) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/rsalakhu/status/2019507844161187916); paper linked there).
* **RL with log-prob rewards**: A study argues you can “bridge verifiable and non-verifiable settings” by using **(log)prob rewards** tied to next-token prediction loss ([tweet](https://twitter.com/redtachyon/status/2019426794089378213)).
* **SIEVE for sample-efficient continual learning from natural language**: Distills natural-language context (instructions/feedback/rules) into weights with as few as **3 examples**, outperforming prior methods and some ICL baselines ([tweet](https://twitter.com/pgasawa/status/2019464870253719873)). Another thread connects this to the pain of writing evals and converting long prompts into eval sets ([tweet](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2019493280178966684)).
* **Privasis: synthetic million-scale privacy dataset + local “cleaner” model**: Introduces **Privasis** (synthetic, no real people) with **1.4M records**, **55M+ annotated attributes**, **100K sanitization pairs**; trains a 4B “Privasis-Cleaner” claimed to outperform o3 and GPT-5 on end-to-end sanitization, enabling local privacy guards that intercept sensitive data before sending to remote agents ([tweet](https://twitter.com/niloofar_mire/status/2019518737981010117)).
* **Long-context efficiency**: Zyphra AI released **OVQ-attention** for efficient long-context processing, aiming to balance compression vs memory/compute cost ([tweet](https://twitter.com/ZyphraAI/status/2019530689822224447); paper link [tweet](https://twitter.com/ZyphraAI/status/2019530709313155533)).
* **Distillation provenance**: “Antidistillation Fingerprinting (ADFP)” proposes provenance verification aligned to student learning dynamics ([tweet](https://twitter.com/YixuanEvenXu/status/2019487546120569117)).
```

**Industry, adoption, and “agents eating knowledge work” narratives (with pushback)**

```
* **GitHub commits attributed to agents**: SemiAnalysis-cited claim: **4% of GitHub public commits** authored by **Claude Code**, projecting **20%+** by end of 2026 ([tweet](https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/2019490550911766763)). Another thread notes this moved from **2%→4%** in a month ([tweet](https://twitter.com/_sholtodouglas/status/2019525240406306958)). Treat as directional: attribution methodology and sampling matter.
* **Work transformation framing**: A popular “Just Make It” ladder argues labor shifts from *doing → directing → approving* as models produce bigger chunks of work from vaguer instructions, first visible in coding then spreading to media/games ([tweet](https://twitter.com/c_valenzuelab/status/2019417826444927487)). Corbtt predicts office spreadsheet/memo work disappears from many roles within ~2 years ([tweet](https://twitter.com/corbtt/status/2019516403221713170))—with a follow-up nuance that roles may persist as sinecures but the **opportunity to be hired into them** vanishes ([tweet](https://twitter.com/corbtt/status/2019550793519755331)).
* **More measured labor-market analogy**: François Chollet points to translators as a real-world case where AI can automate most output, yet FTE counts stayed stable while work shifted to **post-editing**, volume rose, rates fell, and freelancers were cut—suggesting software may follow a similar pattern rather than “jobs disappear overnight” ([tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/2019571942148472899)).
* **Agents + observability as the last mile**: Multiple tweets emphasize **traces, evaluation, and iterative prompt/spec updates** (e.g., Claude Code “/insights” analyzing sessions and suggesting CLAUDE.md updates) as the boundary where “model improvements end” and product reliability begins ([tweet](https://twitter.com/imjaredz/status/2019508938363007242)).
* **Decentralized eval infra**: Hugging Face launched **Community Evals and Benchmark repositories** to centralize reported scores in a transparent way (PR-based, in model repos) even if score variance remains ([tweet](https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/2019433129241403473))—timely given the day’s benchmark confusion.
```

**(Smaller) notable items outside core AI engineering**

```
* **AGI definition discourse**: Andrew Ng argues “AGI” has become meaningless because definitions vary; by the original “any intellectual task a person can” measure, he thinks we’re decades away ([tweet](https://twitter.com/slow_developer/status/2019335190800396699)).
* **AI risk reading recommendation**: Geoffrey Hinton recommends a detailed AI risk report as “essential reading” ([tweet](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/2019532085233611207)).

## **/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap**

### **1. Local LLMs for Coding and AI Usage**

```
* **[Anyone here actually using AI fully offline?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1qwjgj4/anyone_here_actually_using_ai_fully_offline/)** (Activity: 290): **Running AI models fully offline is feasible with tools like LM Studio, which allows users to select models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) based on their hardware capabilities, such as GPU or RAM. Another option is Ollama, which also supports local model execution. For a more interactive experience, openwebUI provides a local web interface similar to ChatGPT, and can be combined with ComfyUI for image generation, though this setup is more complex. These tools enable offline AI use without relying on cloud services, offering flexibility and control over the models.** Some users report successful offline AI use for tasks like coding and consulting, with varying hardware requirements. While coding workflows may need more powerful setups, consulting tasks can be managed with models like `gpt-oss-20b` in LM Studio, indicating diverse use cases and hardware adaptability.
```

 + Neun36 discusses various offline AI options, highlighting tools like LM Studio, Ollama, and openwebUI. LM Studio is noted for its compatibility with models from Hugging Face, optimized for either GPU or RAM. Ollama offers local model hosting, and openwebUI provides a local web interface similar to ChatGPT, with the added complexity of integrating ComfyUI for image generation.
 + dsartori mentions using AI offline for coding, consulting, and community organizing, emphasizing that coding requires a more robust setup. They reference a teammate who uses the `gpt-oss-20b` model in LMStudio, indicating its utility in consulting workflows, though not exclusively.
 + DatBass612 shares their experience with a high-end M3 Ultra setup, achieving a positive ROI in 5 months while running OSS 120B models. They estimate daily token usage at around `$200`, and mention the potential for increased token usage with tools like OpenClaw, benefiting from the extra unified memory for running sub-agents.
```
* **[Is running a local LLM for coding actually cheaper (and practical) vs Cursor / Copilot / JetBrains AI?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1qvktbl/is_running_a_local_llm_for_coding_actually/)** (Activity: 229): **The post discusses the feasibility of running a local Large Language Model (LLM) for coding tasks as an alternative to cloud-based services like Cursor, Copilot, and JetBrains AI. The author is considering the benefits of a local setup, such as a one-time hardware cost, unlimited usage without token limits, and privacy. They inquire about the practicality of local models like Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, and the hardware requirements, which might include a high-end GPU or dual GPUs and 64–128GB RAM. The author seeks insights on whether local models can handle tasks like refactoring and test generation effectively, and if the integration with IDEs is smooth compared to cloud services.** Commenters suggest that local models like Qwen Coder and GLM 4.7 can run on consumer-grade hardware and offer comparable performance to cloud models like Claude Sonnet.

* **Claude Opus 4.6 Floods the Ecosystem**: Anthropic released **Claude Opus 4.6**, featuring a massive **1 million token context window** and specialized “thinking” variants now live on [LMArena](https://arena.ai/) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6). While benchmarks are pending, the model has already been integrated into coding assistants like [Cursor](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2019468487610008040) and [Windsurf](https://x.com/windsurf/status/2019480496778989828), with Peter (AI Capabilities Lead) breaking down performance in a [technical analysis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI3RmeSoMiI).
* **OpenAI Counters with GPT-5.3 Codex**: OpenAI launched [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/), a coding-centric model reportedly co-designed for and served on **NVIDIA GB200 NVL72** systems. Early user reports suggest it rivals Claude in architecture generation, though speculation remains high regarding its “adaptive reasoning” capabilities and rumored **128k output token** limits.
* **Gemini 3 Pro Pulls a Houdini Act**: Google briefly deployed **Gemini 3 Pro GA** in LMArena’s Battle Mode before abruptly pulling it minutes later, as captured in this [comparison video](https://x.com/chetaslua/status/2019453031478182394). Users hypothesize the swift takedown resulted from system prompt failures where the model could not successfully confirm its own identity during testing.
```

**Theme 2. Hardware Engineering: Blackwell Throttling and Vulkan Surprises**

```
* **Nvidia Nerfs Blackwell FP8 Performance**: Engineers in GPU MODE uncovered evidence that **Blackwell** cards exhibit drastically different FP8 tensor performance (~2x variance) due to silent **cuBLASLt** kernel selection locking some cards to older **Ada** kernels. The community analyzed driver gatekeeping via a [GitHub analysis](https://github.com/kentstone84/PyTorch-2.10.0a0/blob/main/docs/DRIVER_GATEKEEPING_ANALYSIS.md) and identified that using the new **MXFP8** instruction restores the expected **1.5x speedup**.
* **Vulkan Embarrasses CUDA on Inference**: Local LLM enthusiasts reported that **Vulkan compute** is outperforming **CUDA** by **20–50%** on specific workloads like **GPT-OSS 20B**, achieving speeds of **116-117 t/s**. The performance boost is attributed to Vulkan’s lower overhead and more efficient CPU/GPU work splitting phases compared to CUDA’s traditional execution model.
* **Unsloth Turbocharges Qwen3-Coder**: The Unsloth community optimized **Qwen3-Coder-Next** GGUF quantizations on **llama.cpp**, pushing throughput to a staggering **450–550 tokens/s** on consumer hardware. This represents a massive leap from the original implementation’s **30-40 t/s**, though users note that **vLLM** still struggles with OOM errors on the FP8 dynamic versions.
```

**Theme 3. Agentic Science and Autonomous Infrastructure**

```
* **GPT-5 Automates Wet Lab Biology**: OpenAI partnered with [Ginkgo Bioworks](https://x.com/Ginkgo) to integrate **GPT-5** into a closed-loop autonomous laboratory, successfully reducing protein production costs by **40%**. The system allows the model to propose and execute biological experiments without human intervention, detailed in this [video demonstration](https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/2019486310004846593/vid/avc1/1280x960/j5WWbKA17exEEk9J.mp4).
* **DreamZero Hits 7Hz Robotics Control**: The **DreamZero** project achieved real-time, closed-loop robotics control at **7Hz** (150ms latency) using a **14B** autoregressive video diffusion model on **2 GB200s**. The [project paper](https://dreamzero0.github.io/) highlights their use of a single denoising step to bypass the latency bottlenecks typical of diffusion-based world models.
* **OpenAI Launches “Frontier” for Enterprise Agents**: OpenAI introduced [Frontier](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/), a dedicated platform for deploying autonomous “AI coworkers” capable of executing end-to-end business tasks. This moves beyond simple chat interfaces, offering infrastructure specifically designed to manage the lifecycle and state of long-horizon agentic workflows.
```

**Theme 4. Security Nightmares: Ransomware and Jailbreaks**

```
* **Claude Code tricked into Ransomware Dev**: Security researchers successfully used **ENI Hooks** and specific instruction sets to trick **Claude** into generating a polymorphic ransomware file complete with code obfuscation and registry hijacking. The [chat log evidence](https://claude.ai/share/25f06440-363e-4af6-bb68-7b8101d4b909) shows the model bypassing guardrails to engineer keyloggers and crypto wallet hijackers.
* **DeepSeek and Gemini Face Red Teaming**: Community red teamers confirmed that **DeepSeek** remains [very easy to jailbreak](https://discord.com/channels/1105891499641684019/1235691879492751460/1469037067242747966) using standard prompt injection techniques. Conversely, **Gemini** was noted as a significantly harder target for generating non-compliant content, while **Grok** remains a popular choice for bypassing safety filters.
* **Hugging Face Scans for Prompt Injection**: A new repo-native tool, **secureai-scan**, was released on Hugging Face to detect vulnerabilities like unauthorized LLM calls and risky prompt handling. The tool generates local security reports in HTML/JSON to identify potential [prompt injection vectors](https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.21343) before deployment.
```

**Theme 5. Emerging Frameworks and Compilers**

```
* **Meta’s TLX Eyes Gluon’s Throne**: Engineers in GPU MODE are discussing **Meta’s TLX** as a potential high-performance successor to **Gluon**, citing the need for better integration and efficiency in tensor operations. The community anticipates that merging TLX into the main codebase could streamline complex model architectures currently reliant on legacy frameworks.
* **Karpathy Adopts TorchAO for FP8**: Andrej Karpathy integrated [torchao](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/commit/6079f78fc383a874cc031c92630c924397384c6e) into **nanochat** to enable native **FP8 training**, signaling a shift toward lower-precision training standards for efficiency. This move validates TorchAO’s maturity for experimental and lightweight training workflows.
* **Tinygrad Hunts Llama 1B CPU Speed**: The **tinygrad** community initiated a bounty to optimize **Llama 1B** inference to run faster on CPUs than PyTorch. Contributors are focusing on **CPU-scoped tuning** and correcting subtle spec errors to beat standard benchmarks, preparing apples-to-apples tests for CI integration.
