After the model was released in late November he built his dream reading app between meetings in one week, work that would have &lt;u>&lt;a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/opus-4-5-collapsed-six-months-of-development-work-into-one-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken him six months before&lt;/a>&lt;/u>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Meanwhile, resident Claude Code wizard &lt;strong>&lt;u>&lt;a href="https://every.to/@kieran_1355" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kieran Klaassen&lt;/a>&lt;/u>&lt;/strong> was so enamored with the model, he started 10 projects at once and kept sneaking away from Thanksgiving dinner to prompt more. “This is by far the most exciting model, maybe ever,” he said.&lt;/p>&lt;p>We knew we needed to do more than write about what we were seeing.
