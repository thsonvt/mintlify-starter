A simple convo between mates - well Moss translated it into words and i’ve been waiting for it to come out so I didn’t front run him.

Enjoy. This is what engineering now looks like in the post loom/gastown era or even when doing ralph loops.

software engineering is now about preventing failure scenarios and preventing the wheel from turning over through back pressure to the generative function

If you aren’t capturing your back-pressure then you are failing as a software engineer.

Back-pressure is part art, part engineering and a whole bung of performance engineering as you need "just enough" to reject invalid generations (aka "hallunications") but if the wheel spins too slow ("tests take a long time to run or for the application to compile") then it's too much resistance.

There are many ways to tune back-pressure and as Moss states it starts with choice of programming language, applying engineering knowledge to design a fast test suite that provides signal but perhaps my favorite one is `pre-commit` hooks (aka prek).

Under normal circumstances pre-commit hooks are annoying because they slow down humans but now that humans aren't the ones doing the software development it really doesn't matter anymore.
