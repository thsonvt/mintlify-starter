I am fortunate to be surrounded by folks who listen and the link below post will go down as a seminal reading for people interested in AI context engineering.

A simple convo between mates - well Moss translated it into words and i’ve been waiting for it to come out so I didn’t front run him.

Back pressure for agents
You might notice a pattern in the most successful applications of agents over the last year. Projects that are able to
setup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able
to push them to work on longer horizon tasks.
This back pressure helps the agent identify mistakes as it progresses and models are now good enough that this feedback
can keep them aligned to a task for much longer. As an engineer, this means you can increase your leverage by delegating
progressively more complex tasks to agents, while increasing trust that when completed they are at a satisfactory standard.

read this and internalise this

Enjoy. This is what engineering now looks like in the post loom/gastown era or even when doing ralph loops.

software engineering is now about preventing failure scenarios and preventing the wheel from turning over through back pressure to the generative function

If you aren’t capturing your back-pressure then you are failing as a software engineer.

Back-pressure is part art, part engineering and a whole bung of performance engineering as you need "just enough" to reject invalid generations (aka "hallunications") but if the wheel spins too slow ("tests take a long time to run or for the application to compile") then it's too much resistance.

There are many ways to tune back-pressure and as Moss states it starts with choice of programming language, applying engineering knowledge to design a fast test suite that provides signal but perhaps my favorite one is `pre-commit` hooks (aka prek).

```

Under normal circumstances pre-commit hooks are annoying because they slow down humans but now that humans aren't the ones doing the software development it really doesn't matter anymore.
