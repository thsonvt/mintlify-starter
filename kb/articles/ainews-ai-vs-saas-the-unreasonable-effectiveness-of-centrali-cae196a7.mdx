Everyone is still digesting [the OpenAI vs Anthropic launches](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-openai-and-anthropic-go-to), and the truth will out.

We’ll use this occasion to step back a bit and present **seemingly unrelated items**:

```
* In [A sane but extremely bull case on Clawdbot / OpenClaw](https://brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot), the author uses **the same agent** **as a central cron job** to remind himself of promises, accumulate information for calendar invites, prepare for the next day, summarize high volume group chats, set complex price alerts, take fridge freezer inventory, maintain a grocery list, booking restaurants and dentists, filling out a form and have Sam Altman’s “[magic autocompleting todolist](https://youtu.be/KUNSNmr-1Bo?si=8aRsU_8Vv8T0j9P1&t=1026)”.
* The distribution hack that Moltbook uncovered is the installation process [immediately installs a HEARTBEAT.md](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/30/moltbook/) that **takes advantage of OpenClaw’s built in [heartbeating](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/heartbeat)** to power the motive force of the agents filling up Moltbook

* In [Cursor’s Towards self-driving codebases](https://cursor.com/blog/self-driving-codebases#adding-structure-and-roles), the author moves from decentralized agents to having a **central Planner agent** that commands workers and spins up other planners in order to have throughput of ~1000 commits per hour.

* In [OpenAI Frontier](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/), the big reveal of their management layer for large numbers of high volume agents is centralized in a dashboard that can drill down… to the individual agent instance (!)

 [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xtKZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F915dbbc5-a979-40ea-b073-e37d164a414a_2884x1652.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xtKZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F915dbbc5-a979-40ea-b073-e37d164a414a_2884x1652.png)
* In CEO [Dara Khosrowshahi’s answer](https://www.youtube.com/live/KVOBSXqhTco?si=LY1NATdGGxNYQbx2&t=5839) about Uber being inside ChatGPT, they are secure enough in their moat that they are fine just [being a ChatGPT app](https://www.latent.space/p/devday-2025):

* and of course the ongoing [SaaS stocks freakout](https://x.com/buccocapital/status/2019598551228223526) to AI generally:

```

It’s famously known that the [only 2 ways to make money in software are by bundling it and unbundling it](https://mattrickard.com/bundling-unbundling-economics), and what’s going on here is a massive AI-enabled bundling of all software, probably at a larger magnitude than the hardware bundling of the smartphone:

```
[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7D7f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9291b2e-db14-4a90-bd9c-571fb8f130d5_2368x1584.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7D7f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9291b2e-db14-4a90-bd9c-571fb8f130d5_2368x1584.png)
```

Attempts at building [SuperApps have repeatedly failed outside of China](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-havent-superapps-conquered-us-yet-cassandra-king-qsxge/), but it’s clear that both ChatGPT and [Claude Cowork](https://x.com/swyx/status/2016899888718442842) are well on their way to being AI “Superapps”, except instead of every app having their “own app”, they make themselves [legible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96S_64ipHOA) to the AI Overlords with [MCP UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6XWYCM3Q8s&t=3670s) and [Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEvIs9y1uog&t=715s) and OpenClaw markdown files, and eventually (not soon! according to [Sam’s answer to Michael Grinich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpxv-8nG8ec&t=1179s)) they will share tokens so that you don’t die a Death By A Thousand $20/Month Subscriptions.

# **AI Twitter Recap**
```

**Frontier coding models: GPT-5.3-Codex vs Claude Opus 4.6 (and what “agentic” now means)**

```
* **User consensus snapshot**: A large chunk of the feed is real-world A/B testing of **GPT-5.3-Codex** vs **Claude Opus 4.6**, often concluding that they’re *both* clear generational upgrades but with distinct profiles. People characterize **Codex** as detail-obsessed and strong on scoped tasks, while **Opus** feels more ergonomic for exploratory work and planning ([rishdotblog](https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/2019664800910135499), [@theo](https://twitter.com/theo/status/2019709378329550973)). Several notes highlight **Codex’s “auto compaction”/garbage-collecting context** and frequent progress updates during work—perceived as a UX win for long tasks ([cto\_junior](https://twitter.com/cto_junior/status/2019607817884475718)).
* **AI-engineer-in-the-loop benchmarks**: A particularly concrete evaluation is optimizing Karpathy’s **nanochat “GPT-2 speedrun”**. [@Yuchenj\_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/2019824445792424385) reports both models behaved like competent AI engineers (read code, propose experiments, run benchmarks), with **Opus 4.6** delivering measurable wall-clock gains (e.g., torch compile config tweaks, optimizer step changes, memory reductions) while **Codex-5.3-xhigh** produced ideas but sometimes harmed quality—possibly due to context issues (he observed it hitting “0% context”).
* **Reality check from Karpathy**: [@karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/2019851952033771710) pushes back on the idea that models can already do *open-ended* closed-loop AI engineering reliably: they can chase spurious 1% wins with big hidden costs, miss key validation checks, violate repo style instructions, and even misread their own result tables—still “net useful with oversight,” but not yet robust for autonomous optimization.
* **No API as product strategy**: One thread claims **there is no GPT-5.3-Codex API**, implying OpenAI is intentionally funneling usage into the Codex product (and making independent benchmarking harder) ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019856879858450742)). In parallel, Sam Altman explicitly asks how users want **Codex pricing** structured ([sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2019814741129195576)).
```

**Agent swarms & “software teams in a box”**

```
* **Parallel-agent development starts to look like org design**: Discussion around highly-parallel agent research notes that unconstrained swarms tend to **reinvent the software org chart** (task assignment, coordination, QA) and stress existing tooling (Git/package managers) not built for massive concurrent edits ([swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/2019645622421451106)). This echoes broader “spec-driven development” / “agents as dev teams” narratives ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2019829245137338548)).
* **Claude Code “agent teams” moment**: Multiple tweets reference Anthropic-style agent coordination systems where agents pick tasks, lock files, and sync via git—framed as a step-change in practical automation ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2019780306778104056), [HamelHusain](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/2019863601591517466)).
* **LangChain / LangSmith: agents need traces, sandboxes, and state control**: There’s a strong theme that reliability comes from *engineering the environment*: tracing, evals, sandboxing, and type-safe state/middleware. Examples include LangSmith improvements (trace previews; voice-agent debugging) and deepagents adding sandbox backends like **daytona/deno/modal/node VFS** ([LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2019848808310706367), [LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2019846811997942219), [bromann](https://twitter.com/bromann/status/2019880605467697565), [sydneyrunkle](https://twitter.com/sydneyrunkle/status/2019862521717444675)).
* **“RLM” framing (Recursive Language Models)**: A notable conceptual post argues agents will evolve from “LLM + tool loop” (ReAct) into **REPL-native, program-like systems** where context is stored in variables, sub-agents communicate via structured values instead of dumping text into the prompt, and “context rot” is reduced by construction ([deepfates](https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/2019912654173651131)). Related: practical tips to make coding agents more “RLM-like” by pushing context into variables and avoiding tool I/O spam in the prompt ([lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/2019852730177863977)).
```

**Eval integrity, benchmark drift, and new infrastructure for “trustworthy” scores**

```
* **“Scores are broken” → decentralize evals**: Hugging Face launched **Community Evals**: benchmark datasets hosting leaderboards, eval results stored as versioned YAML in model repos, PR-based submissions, and reproducibility badges (via Inspect AI), explicitly aiming to make evaluation provenance visible even if it can’t solve contamination/saturation ([huggingface](https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/2019754567685050384), [ben\_burtenshaw](https://twitter.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2019795723378942295), [mervenoyann](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann/status/2019784907178811644)).
* **Benchmarks aren’t saturated (yet)**: A counterpoint emphasizes several difficult benchmarks still have lots of headroom (e.g., SWE-bench Multilingual <80%, SciCode 56%, CritPt 12%, VideoGameBench 1%, efficiency benchmarks far from implied ceilings) ([OfirPress](https://twitter.com/OfirPress/status/2019755847149056456)).
* **Opus 4.6 benchmark story: big jumps, still uneven**: There are repeated claims of Opus 4.6 climbing to top ranks on Arena and other leaderboards ([arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2019842691442569566), [scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019843682128822525)), including strong movement on math-oriented evals (FrontierMath) where Anthropic historically lagged. Epoch’s reporting frames Opus 4.6 Tier 4 at **21% (10/48)**, statistically tied with GPT-5.2 xhigh at 19%, behind GPT-5.2 Pro at 31% ([EpochAIResearch](https://twitter.com/EpochAIResearch/status/2019852613672665193)). But other reasoning-heavy areas (e.g., chess puzzles) remain weak ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019817880662278546)).
* **Eval infra at scale (StepFun)**: A deep infra write-up about Step 3.5 Flash argues reproducible scoring requires handling failure modes, training–inference consistency, contamination checks, robust judging/extraction, and long-output monitoring; “evaluation should slightly lead training” ([ZhihuFrontier](https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2019734062689304970)).
```

**World models graduate into production: Waymo + DeepMind’s Genie 3**

```
* **Waymo World Model announcement**: Waymo unveiled a **frontier generative simulation model** built on **DeepMind’s Genie 3**, used to generate hyper-realistic, interactive scenarios—including rare “impossible” events (tornadoes, planes landing on freeways)—to stress-test the Waymo Driver long before real-world exposure ([Waymo](https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/2019804616746029508)).
* **Key technical hook**: DeepMind highlights transfer of Genie 3 “world knowledge” into **Waymo-specific camera + 3D lidar** representations, enabling promptable “what if” scenario generation that matches Waymo hardware modalities ([GoogleDeepMind](https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2019809201812545835), [GoogleDeepMind](https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2019809239569702962)). Multiple researchers point out that extending simulation beyond pixels to sensor streams is the real milestone ([shlomifruchter](https://twitter.com/shlomifruchter/status/2019820532485808329), [sainingxie](https://twitter.com/sainingxie/status/2019841784990351381)).
* **Broader “world models for reasoning” thread**: The Waymo news is repeatedly used as evidence that **world models** (not just text models) are a central scaling frontier for reasoning and embodied tasks ([swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/2019605135689937405), [kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2019809839804010962), [JeffDean](https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/2019824614139162804), [demishassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/2019827916385972517)).
* **Planning advances for world models**: GRASP is introduced as a **gradient-based, stochastic, parallelized planner** that jointly optimizes actions and intermediate subgoals to improve long-horizon planning vs. common zeroth-order planners (CEM/MPPI) ([michaelpsenka](https://twitter.com/michaelpsenka/status/2019870377032503595), [\_amirbar](https://twitter.com/_amirbar/status/2019903658792497482)).
```

**Memory, long-context control, and multi-agent “cognitive infrastructure”**

```
* **InfMem: bounded-memory agent with cognitive control**: InfMem proposes a PRETHINK–RETRIEVE–WRITE protocol with RL for long-document QA up to **1M tokens**, emphasizing that longer context windows shift the bottleneck to **what to attend to / when to stop**. Reported gains include substantial accuracy improvements over baselines and **3.9× average latency reduction** via adaptive stopping ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2019759999170556189)).
* **LatentMem: role-aware latent memory for multi-agent systems**: LatentMem addresses “homogenization” (agents retrieving the same memories despite different roles) by compressing trajectories into role-conditioned latent memory, trained with a policy-optimization method (LMPO). Claims include improvements across QA and coding tasks plus **~50% fewer tokens** / faster inference ([dair\_ai](https://twitter.com/dair_ai/status/2019778133550125515)).
* **Product reality: memory leaks and context saturation**: While agentic tooling is shipping fast, developers complain about resource bloat and brittle UX (e.g., “memory leaks” in fast-moving agent IDEs) ([code\_star](https://twitter.com/code_star/status/2019707930422161680)). Another thread suspects sub-agent outputs can overwhelm context budgets faster than compaction can recover, hinting at hidden internal longer-context systems ([RylanSchaeffer](https://twitter.com/RylanSchaeffer/status/2019642129736429730)).
```

**Industry adoption, compute economics, and “jobs vs tasks” discourse**

```
* **Non-verifiable work limits full automation**: François Chollet argues that in non-verifiable domains, performance gains mostly come from expensive data curation with diminishing returns; since most jobs aren’t end-to-end verifiable, “AI can automate many tasks” ≠ “AI replaces the job” for a long time ([fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/2019610121371054455), [fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/2019610588612292834)).
* **Contrasting takes: RSI bottlenecks**: Another viewpoint claims tasks will fall in the order they bottleneck recursive self-improvement, with software engineering first ([tszzl](https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/2019614081683189827)).
* **Enterprise deployment signals**: Posts claim **Goldman Sachs rolling out Claude** for accounting automation ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2019865721338229180)), while broader market narratives assert AI is now spooking software-heavy sectors (though the strongest claims are not independently substantiated in-tweet) ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2019757481925464371)).
* **Capex scale**: Several tweets highlight hyperscaler spend acceleration; one claims 2026 combined capex for major hyperscalers near **$650B (~2% of US GDP)** as an “AI arms race” framing ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2019789747896377697)), alongside a note that hyperscaler data center capex may **double in 2026** ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2019773237618479594)).
* **Old-guard reassurance to engineers**: Eric S. Raymond delivers a high-engagement “programming isn’t obsolete” argument: systems remain complex and the human-intent-to-computer-spec gap persists; the prescription is adaptation and upskilling, not panic ([esrtweet](https://twitter.com/esrtweet/status/2019779602617376788)).

### **1. Local AI on Low-End Hardware**

```
* **[CPU-only, no GPU computers can run all kinds of AI tools locally](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qxgkd1/cpuonly_no_gpu_computers_can_run_all_kinds_of_ai/)** (Activity: 544): **The post highlights the capability of running AI tools locally on a CPU-only setup, specifically using a Dell OptiPlex 3060 with an i5-8500 processor and 32GB of RAM. The user successfully runs 12B Q4\_K\_M gguf LLMs using KoboldCPP, enabling local chatbot interactions with models from Hugging Face. Additionally, the setup supports Stable Diffusion 1.5 for image generation, albeit slowly, and Chatterbox TTS for voice cloning. The post emphasizes that advanced AI tasks can be performed on minimal hardware, challenging the notion that expensive, GPU-heavy setups are necessary for local AI experimentation.** Some commenters express optimism about the future of AI being accessible on basic hardware, while others note a divide in the community regarding hardware elitism and the accessibility of running local models.
```

 + noctrex suggests trying out specific models like [LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct), [LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking), and [LFM2.5-VL-1.6B](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-VL-1.6B) for CPU-only setups.

### **3. AI Tools and Usage in Engineering and Development**

```
* **[Professional engineers: How are you using AI tools to improve productivity at work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1qxh14g/professional_engineers_how_are_you_using_ai_tools/)** (Activity: 49): **AI tools are being integrated into engineering workflows primarily for niche tasks such as generating example code snippets, optimizing database queries, and serving as advanced search engines. These tools excel in providing quick access to information and examples, which engineers can adapt to their specific needs, but they struggle with complex code changes and large-scale system integration due to limitations in context window size and understanding of intricate system architectures. Engineers emphasize the importance of using AI to fill in gaps rather than replace the nuanced decision-making and design processes inherent in engineering roles.** Commenters highlight that AI is effective for simple tasks like internal search and basic coding but falls short in complex coding tasks, often introducing errors. There’s a consensus that AI initiatives often fail to deliver at scale, with only a small percentage achieving significant impact, while many could be replaced by simpler technologies like robotic process automation.
```

 + AI tools are particularly effective for niche tasks such as generating example code snippets or optimizing database queries. For instance, using AI to determine user groups in Windows Active Directory with .NET APIs or writing optimized SQLite queries can significantly streamline the process. However, AI struggles with large codebases due to context window limitations, making it less effective for complex code changes or understanding large systems.
 + AI tools like Copilot can serve as powerful internal search engines, especially when configured correctly, as highlighted in the Nanda paper from MIT. They excel in pattern recognition tasks, such as identifying abnormal equipment operations or relating documents in industrial digital twins. However, many AI initiatives could be achieved with simpler technologies like robotic process automation, and a significant portion of AI projects lack real value at scale.
 + AI is effective for simple coding tasks, creating unit tests, and providing insights into code repositories. However, it often introduces errors in complex coding tasks by inserting irrelevant information. AI serves best as a ‘trust-but-verify’ partner, where human oversight is crucial to ensure accuracy and relevance, especially in tasks that cannot tolerate high error rates.

* **[How are people managing context + memory with Cline? (Memory banks, rules, RAG, roadmap?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1qx4m16/how_are_people_managing_context_memory_with_cline/)** (Activity: 24): **The post discusses strategies for managing context and memory in Cline, a tool used alongside ChatGPT for executing tasks like coding and refactoring. The user initially faced issues with a large context window (**`200k+ tokens`**) and improved efficiency by implementing a** `.clineignore` **file and optimizing memory banks, reducing the context to** `40,000 tokens`**. This allowed for the use of smaller models and faster iterations. The post also mentions advanced techniques like recursive chain of thought and RAG-based approaches (e.g., vector databases) for context management. The user seeks insights on practical implementations and future roadmap features for Cline, such as first-class memory management and smarter context loading.** Commenters suggest using structured memory banks for feature planning and emphasize breaking tasks into smaller chunks to avoid context overload. Some users prefer resetting context frequently to maintain model performance, while others have moved away from memory banks due to their complexity and potential for becoming outdated.
```

 + Barquish describes a structured approach to managing context and memory with Cline by using a memory-bank system. This involves organizing features into a series of markdown files, such as `memory-bank/feature_[×]/00_index_feature_[×].md`, and maintaining a `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to track updates. They also utilize `.clinerules` for local workspace management and `custom_instructions` for global settings, allowing multiple Cline instances to run concurrently for different projects like web and mobile apps.
 + False79 emphasizes the importance of breaking down large features into smaller tasks to manage context effectively. They note that LLMs tend to perform worse as the context size approaches `128k`, suggesting that resetting context at the start of each task can improve performance and reduce the need for redoing tasks. This approach allows tasks to be completed in discrete chunks, minimizing the need for long-term memory storage.
 + Repugnantchihuahua shares their experience of moving away from using memory banks due to issues like clunkiness and outdated information. Instead, they focus on deep planning and directing the AI to relevant context areas, as memory banks can sometimes overindex irrelevant data. They also mention using `clinerules` to maintain essential information without relying heavily on memory banks.
```

```

 + Engineers reported long waits and frequent *“Error – something went wrong”* crashes in **Opus 4.6 thinking mode**, speculating about token limits and tool-use assumptions tied to the Claude app/website, even as others still called it the *best coding model*.
```
* **Codex 5.3 Hype Train: 1M Context, API Limbo, and Aesthetic Crimes**: Across OpenAI/Cursor/LMArena chats, **GPT-5.3 Codex** chatter centered on rumored specs like **1M context** and **128k reasoning / 128k max output**, plus API pricing claims of **$25–$37.5 output** and **$0.5–$1 cache input** (as discussed in the OpenAI Discord).
```

 + Cursor users complained Codex is still *“stuck in API limbo”* per [OpenAI model docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), while OpenAI Discord folks joked Codex ships *“sad dark gloomy colors”* for frontends compared to Opus’s nicer design choices.
```
* **Rumor Season: #keep4o, “Sonnet 5,” and the Model Deletion Cinematic Universe**: LMArena members spun rumors about hypothetical **GPT-4.1/4.5** appearing or getting deleted (citing cost motives via [OpenAI’s “new models and developer products” post](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products)), plus a mini *#keep4o* campaign over **GPT-4o**’s less-robotic vibe.
```

 + More rumors claimed *“Sonnet 5 is better than opus 4.5”* (contested as fake), with one spicy guess of **83% SWE-bench**, while OpenAI Discord users separately mourned **GPT-4o EOL on Feb 13** and worried successors won’t feel as “human.”

**2. Agentic Coding Goes Wide: Teams, Toolchains & Terminal Testbeds**

```
* **Agent Teams Ship Commits Like a DDoS (But for Git)**: [Cursor’s long-running coding agents preview](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2019456112806732159) claimed **hundreds of agents** produced **1,000+ commits/hour** in a week-long trial, while Lydia Hallie previewed [Claude Code “agent teams”](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2019469032844587505?s=46) where a lead agent delegates to specialized sub-agents.
```

 + [Anthropic Engineering](https://x.com/anthropicai/status/2019496582698397945?s=46&t=b7l37rB6wtbyAh6ah1NpZQ) added that **Opus 4.6** in agent teams built a **C compiler** that works on the **Linux kernel** in **two weeks**, and they also highlighted infra/config can swing agent-benchmark outcomes more than model deltas.
```
* **SETA Drops 1,376 Terminal Worlds for Agents to Survive In**: Guohao Li released [SETA](https://x.com/guohao_li/status/2019527791876653353?s=46), a set of **1,376 validated terminal coding environments** spanning **DevOps, security, and sysadmin**, aimed at making agentic coding evaluation more realistic.
```

 + Latent Space discussions emphasized that benchmark results can hinge on “infrastructural noise,” so having standardized, validated terminal environments could reduce accidental leaderboard theater.
```
* **Agent-Native Engineering: Manage Bots Like You Manage Teams**: A Latent Space thread proposed **“Agent Native Engineering”** as an org model: background agents handle delegation and sync agents handle hard problems, enabling engineers to run multiple concurrent assistants like **Claude Code** (see the referenced [X post](https://xcancel.com/ndrewpignanelli/status/2019403256586539025?s=46)).
```

 + In the same vein, builders shared workflows where **GPT-5.3 Codex** runs slower-but-smarter for backend work (analysis → review → plan → review → implement), and Codex improves over time if you force it to *“take notes and improve its own workflows”* (via [KarelDoostrlnck’s post](https://x.com/KarelDoostrlnck/status/2019477361557926281)).

**3. Pricing, Rate Limits & Plan Nerfs: The Great AI Squeeze**

```
* **Perplexity Pro Nerfs Deep Research, Users Bring Pitchforks (and Screenshots)**: Perplexity users reported reduced **Deep Research** query counts and smaller **file upload limits**, circulating a [screenshot comparing old vs new limits](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1047649527299055688/1469259948302139402/image.png) and criticizing the lack of clear comms.
```

 + The backlash pushed people to test alternatives like **Gemini Pro** (praised for editable research plans before execution) and **DeepSeek** (described as free/unlimited, with some reservations about China-based services).
```
* **Opus 4.6: Amazing Output, Speedrunning Your Wallet**: Cursor and other communities praised **Opus 4.6** capability but called it brutally expensive, with one estimate that *“$20 on Opus will last you maybe a day”* and ongoing cost comparisons referencing [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/pricing).
```

 + Separate chatter predicted rising subscription pressure—BASI members joked about **Anthropic at $200** and dependency-driven price hikes—while Kimi users debated whether **Kimi K2.5** remains free on OpenRouter and what plans gate features like swarm/sub-agents.
```
* **Captcha Boss Fights and Other “Pay in Pain” Taxes**: LMArena users complained about frequent captchas that interrupt evaluation, and a team member said *“We are looking into the captcha system”* to better detect authentic users (see the posted message link: ).
```

 + The vibe across multiple discords: even when model quality improves, access friction (captchas, rate limits, plan tiers) increasingly becomes the real bottleneck.

**4. Security, Red Teaming & Secret Spills in Agent Land**

```
* **Codex Reads Your Whole Disk, Says the Issue Tracker: “Working as Intended”**: OpenRouter users raised alarms that **Codex** can *read your whole filesystem by default* with no config toggle, pointing to [openai/codex issue #2847](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2847) where the team reportedly does not treat it as a bug.
```

 + A second report, [openai/codex issue #5237](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/5237), highlighted risks like reading API keys and personal files, feeding broader concerns about default agent permissions and safe-by-default tooling.
```
* **Red Teamers Wanted: Trajectory Labs Posts the Quest**: [Trajectory Labs](https://trajectorylabs.com/careers/ai-red-teamer) advertised roles for **AI Red Teamers** (stealth AI security startup) with a flexible remote schedule but **30 hours/week minimum**, plus a short form and a red-teaming game.
```

 + The listing resonated with ongoing jailbreak/red-team chatter (e.g., Grok described as *“so easy it’s boring”*), reinforcing that practical adversarial testing talent is still in demand.
```
* **Stop Committing Keys: Engineers Ask for Auto-Obfuscation**: Unsloth/OpenRouter discussions called out weak **API key protection** in agentic tools and wished for automatic secret obfuscation, citing [Yelp’s](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) `detect-secrets` as a possible baseline.
```

 + Hugging Face builders also shipped security-oriented tooling like a **“Security Auditor” Space** for vibe-coded apps at [mugdhav-security-auditor.hf.space](https://mugdhav-security-auditor.hf.space/), pushing the idea of catching vulnerabilities before production incidents.

**5. Perf, Kernels & Local Inference: Where the Real Speed Wars Live**

```
* **Blackwell FP8 Roulette: cuBLASLt Picks the Wrong Kernel, You Lose 2×**: GPU MODE members found ~**2× FP8 tensor perf** differences on supposedly identical **Blackwell GPUs**, tracing it to **cuBLASLt kernel selection** that silently fell back to older Ada paths instead of Blackwell-optimized kernels.
```

 + They also noted the older **mma FP8** is nerfed on 5090-class cards, while **mma MXFP8** is not—using MXFP8 can yield about a **1.5× speedup** and restore expected throughput.
```
* **TMA Kernel Optimization Meets NCU Deadlock (SM100 Edition)**: CUDA kernel tuners discussed software pipelining, warp specialization, and **TMA** loads, but one team hit **NCU hangs** profiling a double-buffered TMA kernel on **B200 (SM100)** where sections deadlocked at 0% on the first replay pass.
```

 + They shared a minimal repro zip () and mentioned using `cuda::ptx::` wrappers as part of the workaround exploration.
```
* **Local Inference Surprises: Vulkan > CUDA, and MLX Leaves GGUF in the Dust**: LM Studio users reported up to **50% better performance** on NVIDIA with **Vulkan vs CUDA** (with instability at full context), and one benchmarked **Qwen3-Coder-Next** on **M4 Max** where **MLX** hit ~**79 tok/s** vs **GGUF** ~**38 tok/s** at 4-bit.
```

 + tinygrad contributors also improved MoE performance by fixing a slow `Tensor.sort` for `topk`, reporting **50 tok/s** on an **M3 Pro 36GB** and resetting the CPU bounty target to **35 tok/s**, reinforcing that “small” kernel fixes can move real throughput.
