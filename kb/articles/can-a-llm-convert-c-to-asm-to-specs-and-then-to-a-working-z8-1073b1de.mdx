[Damien Guard](https://bsky.app/profile/damieng.bsky.social/post/3ljdkwup7sc2d?ref=ghuntley.com) nerd sniped me and other folks wanted more proof that it is now cheap, easy and possible to [cheaply rewrite software or clone existing "source available" businesses](https://ghuntley.com/tradecraft/) (see bottom of the post).
```

> five months later and [https://t.co/kMXyRYraBA](https://t.co/kMXyRYraBA?ref=ghuntley.com) has been productionised into a MCP server and a paper published. that took longer than expected but it was only matter of time.
