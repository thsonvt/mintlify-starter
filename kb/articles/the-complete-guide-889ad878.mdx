Introduction
A skill is a set of instructions - packaged as a simple folder - that teaches Claude 
how to handle specific tasks or workflows. Skills are one of the most powerful 
ways to customize Claude for your specific needs. Instead of re-explaining your 
preferences, processes, and domain expertise in every conversation, skills let you 
teach Claude once and benefit every time. 
Skills are powerful when you have repeatable workflows: generating frontend 
designs from specs, conducting research with consistent methodology, creating 
documents that follow your team's style guide, or orchestrating multi-step 
processes. They work well with Claude's built-in capabilities like code execution 
and document creation. For those building MCP integrations, skills add another 
powerful layer helping turn raw tool access into reliable, optimized workflows.
This guide covers everything you need to know to build effective skills - from 
planning and structure to testing and distribution. Whether you're building a 
skill for yourself , your team, or for the community , you'll find practical patterns 
and real-world examples throughout. 
What you'll learn: 
• T echnical requirements and best practices for skill structure 
• Patterns for standalone skills and MCP-enhanced workflows
• Patterns we've seen work well across different use cases 
• How to test, iterate, and distribute your skills 
Who this is for: 
• Developers who want Claude to follow specific workflows consistently 
• Power users who want Claude to follow specific workflows 
• T eams looking to standardize how Claude works across their organization 
Two Paths Through This Guide 
Building standalone skills? Focus on Fundamentals, Planning and Design, and 
category 1-2. Enhancing an MCP integration? The "Skills + MCP" section and 
category 3 are for you. Both paths share the same technical requirements, but 
you choose what's relevant to your use case.
What you'll get out of this guide: By the end, you'll be able to build a functional 
skill in a single sitting. Expect about 15-30 minutes to build and test your first 
working skill using the skill-creator .
Let's get started.

Chapter 1
Fundamentals
What is a skill?
A skill is a folder containing:
• SKILL.md (required): Instructions in Markdown with Y AML frontmatter
• scripts/ (optional): Executable code (Python, Bash, etc.)
• references/ (optional): Documentation loaded as needed
• assets/ (optional): T emplates, fonts, icons used in output
Core design principles
Progressive Disclosure
Skills use a three-level system:
• First level (Y AML frontmatter): Always loaded in Claude's system prompt. 
Provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should 
be used without loading all of it into context.
• Second level (SKILL.md body): Loaded when Claude thinks the skill is 
relevant to the current task. Contains the full instructions and guidance.
• Third level (Linked files): Additional files bundled within the skill directory 
that Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed.
This progressive disclosure minimizes token usage while maintaining 
specialized expertise.
Composability
Claude can load multiple skills simultaneously . Y our skill should work well 
alongside others, not assume it's the only capability available.
Portability
Skills work identically across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Create a skill once 
and it works across all surfaces without modification, provided the environment 
supports any dependencies the skill requires.
For MCP Builders: Skills + Connectors
💡  Building standalone skills without MCP? Skip to Planning and Design - you can 
always return here later.
If you already have a working MCP server, you've done the hard part. Skills are 
the knowledge layer on top - capturing the workflows and best practices you 
already know , so Claude can apply them consistently .
The kitchen analogy
MCP provides the professional kitchen: access to tools, ingredients, and 
equipment.
Skills provide the recipes: step-by-step instructions on how to create something 
valuable.
5

T ogether , they enable users to accomplish complex tasks without needing to 
figure out every step themselves.
How they work together:
MCP (Connectivity) Skills (Knowledge)
Connects Claude to your service 
(Notion, Asana, Linear, etc.)
T eaches Claude how to use your service 
effectively
Provides real-time data access and tool 
invocation
Captures workflows and best practices
What Claude can do How Claude should do it
Why this matters for your MCP users
Without skills:
• Users connect your MCP but don't know what to do next 
• Support tickets asking "how do I do X with your integration" 
• Each conversation starts from scratch
• Inconsistent results because users prompt differently each time
• Users blame your connector when the real issue is workflow guidance
With skills:
• Pre-built workflows activate automatically when needed
• Consistent, reliable tool usage
• Best practices embedded in every interaction
• Lower learning curve for your integration

Chapter 2
Planning and design
Start with use cases
Before writing any code, identify 2-3 concrete use cases your skill should enable.
Good use case definition:
Use Case: Project Sprint Planning 
Trigger: User says "help me plan this sprint" or "create 
sprint tasks" 
Steps: 
1. Fetch current project status from Linear (via MCP) 
2. Analyze team velocity and capacity 
3. Suggest task prioritization 
4. Create tasks in Linear with proper labels and estimates 
Result: Fully planned sprint with tasks created
Ask yourself:
• What does a user want to accomplish?
• What multi-step workflows does this require ?
• Which tools are needed (built-in or MCP?)
• What domain knowledge or best practices should be embedded?
Common skill use case categories
A t Anthropic, we’ve observed three common use cases:
Category 1: Document & Asset Creation
Used for: Creating consistent, high-quality output including documents, 
presentations, apps, designs, code, etc.
Real example: frontend-design skill (also see skills for docx, pptx, xlsx, and 
ppt)
"Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design 
quality . Use when building web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or 
applications."
Key techniques:
• Embedded style guides and brand standards
• T emplate structures for consistent output
• Quality checklists before finalizing
• No external tools required - uses Claude's built-in capabilities
8

Category 2: W orkflow Automation 
Used for: Multi-step processes that benefit from consistent methodology , 
including coordination across multiple MCP servers.
Real example: skill-creator skill
"Interactive guide for creating new skills. W alks the user through use case 
definition, frontmatter generation, instruction writing, and validation."
Key techniques:
• Step-by-step workflow with validation gates
• T emplates for common structures
• Built-in review and improvement suggestions
• Iterative refinement loops
Category 3: MCP Enhancement
Used for: W orkflow guidance to enhance the tool access an MCP server provides.
Real example: sentry-code-review skill (from Sentry)
"Automatically analyzes and fixes detected bugs in GitHub Pull Requests using 
Sentry's error monitoring data via their MCP server ."
Key techniques:
• Coordinates multiple MCP calls in sequence
• Embeds domain expertise 
• Provides context users would otherwise need to specify
• Error handling for common MCP issues
Define success criteria
How will you know your skill is working?
These are aspirational targets - rough benchmarks rather than precise 
thresholds. Aim for rigor but accept that there will be an element of vibes-based 
assessment. W e are actively developing more robust measurement guidance and 
tooling.
Quantitative metrics:
• Skill triggers on 90% of relevant queries
 – How to measure: Run 10-20 test queries that should trigger your skill. Track 
how many times it loads automatically vs. requires explicit invocation.
• Completes workflow in X tool calls
 – How to measure: Compare the same task with and without the skill enabled. 
Count tool calls and total tokens consumed. 
• 0 failed API calls per workflow
 – How to measure: Monitor MCP server logs during test runs. Track retry rates 
and error codes.
Qualitative metrics:
• Users don't need to prompt Claude about next steps
 – How to assess: During testing, note how often you need to redirect or clarify . 
Ask beta users for feedback.  
• W orkflows complete without user correction
 – How to assess: Run the same request 3-5 times. Compare outputs for 
structural consistency and quality .
• Consistent results across sessions
 – How to assess: Can a new user accomplish the task on first try with minimal 
guidance?

T echnical requirements
File structure
your-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file
├── scripts/              # Optional - executable code
│   ├── process_data.py # Example
│   └── validate.sh # Example
├── references/           # Optional - documentation
│   ├── api-guide.md # Example
│   └── examples/ # Example
└── assets/              # Optional - templates, etc.
    └── report-template.md # Example
Critical rules
SKILL.md naming:
• Must be exactly SKILL.md (case-sensitive)
• No variations accepted (SKILL.MD, skill.md, etc.)
Skill folder naming:
• Use kebab-case: notion-project-setup ✅
• No spaces: Notion Project Setup ❌
• No underscores: notion_project_setup ❌
• No capitals: NotionProjectSetup ❌
No README.md:
• Don't include README.md inside your skill folder
• All documentation goes in SKILL.md or references/
• Note: when distributing via GitHub, you'll still want a repo-level README for 
human users — see Distribution and Sharing.
Y AML frontmatter: The most important part
The Y AML frontmatter is how Claude decides whether to load your skill. Get this 
right.
Minimal required format
---
name: your-skill-name
description: What it does. Use when user asks to [specific 
phrases].
---
That's all you need to start.
Field requirements
name (required):
• kebab-case only
• No spaces or capitals
• Should match folder name
description (required):
• MUST include BOTH:
 – What the skill does
 – When to use it (trigger conditions)
• Under 1024 characters
• No XML tags ( &lt; or >)
• Include specific tasks users might say
• Mention file types if relevant
10

license (optional):
• Use if making skill open source
• Common: MIT , Apache-2.0
compatibility (optional)
• 1-500 characters 
• Indicates environment requirements: e.g. intended product, required system 
packages, network access needs, etc.
metadata (optional): 
• Any custom key-value pairs 
• Suggested: author , version, mcp-server 
• Example: 

```yaml 
metadata: 
 author: ProjectHub 
 version: 1.0.0 mcp-server: projecthub 

```
Security restrictions
Forbidden in frontmatter:
• XML angle brackets (&lt; >)
• Skills with "claude" or "anthropic" in name (reserved)
Why: Frontmatter appears in Claude's system prompt. Malicious content could 
inject instructions.
Writing effective skills
The description field
According to Anthropic's engineering blog: "This metadata...provides just 
enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without 
loading all of it into context." This is the first level of progressive disclosure.
Structure:
[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key capabilities]
Examples of good descriptions:
# Good - specific and actionable
description: Analyzes Figma design files and generates 
developer handoff documentation. Use when user uploads .fig 
files, asks for "design specs", "component documentation", or 
"design-to-code handoff".
# Good - includes trigger phrases
description: Manages Linear project workflows including sprint 
planning, task creation, and status tracking. Use when user 
mentions "sprint", "Linear tasks", "project planning", or asks 
to "create tickets".
# Good - clear value proposition
description: End-to-end customer onboarding workflow for 
PayFlow. Handles account creation, payment setup, and 
subscription management. Use when user says "onboard new 
customer", "set up subscription", or "create PayFlow account".
11

Examples of bad descriptions:
# Too vague
description: Helps with projects.
# Missing triggers
description: Creates sophisticated multi-page documentation 
systems.
# Too technical, no user triggers
description: Implements the Project entity model with 
hierarchical relationships.
W riting the main instructions
After the frontmatter , write the actual instructions in Markdown.
Recommended structure:
Adapt this template for your skill. Replace bracketed sections with your specific 
content.
---
name: your-skill
description: [--.]
---
# Your Skill Name
-# Instructions
--# Step 1: [First Major Step]
Clear explanation of what happens.
Example:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_data.py --project-id PROJECT_ID
Expected output: [describe what success looks like]
(Add more steps as needed)
Examples
Example 1: [common scenario]
User says: "Set up a new marketing campaign"
Actions:
1. Fetch existing campaigns via MCP 
2. Create new campaign with provided parameters
Result: Campaign created with confirmation link
(Add more examples as needed)
Troubleshooting
Error: [Common error message]
Cause: [Why it happens] 
Solution: [How to fix]
(Add more error cases as needed)
12

Best Practices for Instructions
Be Specific and Actionable
✅   Good:
Run `python scripts/validate.py --input &#123;filename&#125;` to check 
data format.
If validation fails, common issues include:
- Missing required fields (add them to the CSV)
- Invalid date formats (use YYYY-MM-DD)
❌   Bad:
Validate the data before proceeding.
Include error handling
-# Common Issues
--# MCP Connection Failed
If you see "Connection refused":
1. Verify MCP server is running: Check Settings > Extensions
2. Confirm API key is valid
3. Try reconnecting: Settings > Extensions > [Your Service] > 
Reconnect
 
Reference bundled resources clearly
Before writing queries, consult `references/api-patterns.md` 
for:
- Rate limiting guidance
- Pagination patterns
- Error codes and handling
Use progressive disclosure
Keep SKILL.md focused on core instructions. Move detailed documentation to 
`references/` and link to it. (See Core Design Principles for how the three-
level system works.)

Chapter 3
T esting and iteration
14

Chapter 3
Testing and iteration
Skills can be tested at varying levels of rigor depending on your needs:
• Manual testing in Claude.ai - Run queries directly and observe behavior . Fast 
iteration, no setup required.
• Scripted testing in Claude Code - Automate test cases for repeatable 
validation across changes.
• Programmatic testing via skills API - Build evaluation suites that run 
systematically against defined test sets.
Choose the approach that matches your quality requirements and the visibility 
of your skill. A skill used internally by a small team has different testing needs 
than one deployed to thousands of enterprise users.
Pro Tip: Iterate on a single task before expanding
W e’ve found that the most effective skill creators iterate on a single challenging 
task until Claude succeeds, then extract the winning approach into a skill. This 
leverages Claude’ s in-context learning and provides faster signal than broad 
testing. Once you have a working foundation, expand to multiple test cases for 
coverage.
Recommended T esting Approach
Based on early experience, effective skills testing typically covers three areas:
1. T riggering tests
Goal: Ensure your skill loads at the right times.
Test cases:
•  ✅   Triggers on obvious tasks
•  ✅   Triggers on paraphrased requests
•  ❌   Doesn't trigger on unrelated topics
Example test suite:
Should trigger:
- "Help me set up a new ProjectHub workspace"
- "I need to create a project in ProjectHub"
- "Initialize a ProjectHub project for Q4 planning"
Should NOT trigger:
- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
- "Help me write Python code"
- "Create a spreadsheet" (unless ProjectHub skill handles 
sheets)
15

2. Functional tests
Goal: V erify the skill produces correct outputs.
Test cases:
• V alid outputs generated
• API calls succeed
• Error handling works
• Edge cases covered
Example:
Test: Create project with 5 tasks
Given: Project name "Q4 Planning", 5 task descriptions
When: Skill executes workflow
Then: 
  - Project created in ProjectHub
  - 5 tasks created with correct properties
  - All tasks linked to project
  - No API errors
3. P erformance comparison
Goal: Prove the skill improves results vs. baseline.
Use the metrics from Define Success Criteria. Here's what a comparison might 
look like.
Baseline comparison:
Without skill:
- User provides instructions each time
- 15 back-and-forth messages
- 3 failed API calls requiring retry
- 12,000 tokens consumed
With skill:
- Automatic workflow execution
- 2 clarifying questions only
- 0 failed API calls
- 6,000 tokens consumed
Using the skill-creator skill
The skill-creator skill - available in Claude.ai via plugin directory or 
download for Claude Code - can help you build and iterate on skills. If you 
have an MCP server and know your top 2–3 workflows, you can build and test a 
functional skill in a single sitting - often in 15–30 minutes.
Creating skills: 
• Generate skills from natural language descriptions 
• Produce properly formatted SKILL.md with frontmatter 
• Suggest trigger phrases and structure 
Reviewing skills: 
• Flag common issues (vague descriptions, missing triggers, structural 
problems) 
• Identify potential over/under-triggering risks 
• Suggest test cases based on the skill's stated purpose 
Iterative improvement: 
• After using your skill and encountering edge cases or failures, bring those 
examples back to skill-creator 
• Example: "Use the issues & solution identified in this chat to improve how the 
skill handles [specific edge case]" 
 
 
 
 16

To use:
"Use the skill-creator skill to help me build a skill for 
[your use case]"
Note: skill-creator helps you design and refine skills but does not execute 
automated test suites or produce quantitative evaluation results.
Iteration based on feedback
Skills are living documents. Plan to iterate based on:
Undertriggering signals:
• Skill doesn't load when it should
• Users manually enabling it
• Support questions about when to use it
Solution: Add more detail and nuance to the description - this may include 
keywords particularly for technical terms
Overtriggering signals:
• Skill loads for irrelevant queries
• Users disabling it
• Confusion about purpose
Solution: Add negative triggers, be more specific
Execution issues:
• Inconsistent results
• API call failures
• User corrections needed
Solution: Improve instructions, add error handling
17

Chapter 4
Distribution and 
sharing
18

Chapter 4
Distribution and sharing
Skills make your MCP integration more complete. As users compare connectors, 
those with skills offer a faster path to value, giving you an edge over MCP-only 
alternatives.
Current distribution model (January 2026)
How individual users get skills:
1. Download the skill folder 
2. Zip the folder (if needed)
3. Upload to Claude.ai via Settings > Capabilities > Skills
4. Or place in Claude Code skills directory
Organization-level skills:
• Admins can deploy skills workspace-wide (shipped December 18, 2025)
• Automatic updates
• Centralized management
An open standard
W e've published Agent Skills as an open standard. Like MCP , we believe skills 
should be portable across tools and platforms - the same skill should work 
whether you're using Claude or other AI platforms. That said, some skills are 
designed to take full advantage of a specific platform's capabilities; authors can 
note this in the skill's compatibility field. W e've been collaborating with 
members of the ecosystem on the standard, and we're excited by early adoption.
Using skills via API 
For programmatic use cases - such as building applications, agents, or automated 
workflows that leverage skills - the API provides direct control over skill 
management and execution. 
Key capabilities: 
•  `/v1/skills` endpoint for listing and managing skills 
• Add skills to Messages API requests via the `container.skills` parameter 
• V ersion control and management through the Claude Console 
• W orks with the Claude Agent SDK for building custom agents 
When to use skills via the API vs. Claude.ai: 
Use Case Best Surface
End users interacting with skills directly Claude.ai / Claude Code
Manual testing and iteration during development Claude.ai / Claude Code
Individual, ad-hoc workflows Claude.ai / Claude Code
Applications using skills programmatically API
Production deployments at scale API
Automated pipelines and agent systems API
19

Note: Skills in the API require the Code Execution T ool beta, which provides the 
secure environment skills need to run. 
For implementation details, see: 
• Skills API Quickstart
• Create Custom skills
• Skills in the Agent SDK
Recommended approach today
Start by hosting your skill on GitHub with a public repo, clear README (for 
human visitors — this is separate from your skill folder , which should not contain 
a README.md), and example usage with screenshots. Then add a section 
to your MCP documentation that links to the skill, explains why using both 
together is valuable, and provides a quick -start guide.
1. Host on GitHub
 – Public repo for open-source skills
 – Clear README with installation instructions
 – Example usage and screenshots
2. Document in Y our MCP Repo
 – Link to skills from MCP documentation
 – Explain the value of using both together
 – Provide quick -start guide
3. Create an Installation Guide
-# Installing the [Your Service] skill
1. Download the skill:
   - Clone repo: `git clone https:-/github.com/yourcompany/  
     skills`
   - Or download ZIP from Releases  
2. Install in Claude:
   - Open Claude.ai > Settings > skills
   - Click "Upload skill"
   - Select the skill folder (zipped)
3. Enable the skill:
   - Toggle on the [Your Service] skill
   - Ensure your MCP server is connected
4. Test:
   - Ask Claude: "Set up a new project in [Your Service]"
Positioning your skill
How you describe your skill determines whether users understand its value and 
actually try it. When writing about your skill—in your README, documentation, 
or marketing - keep these principles in mind.
Focus on outcomes, not features:
✅   Good:
"The ProjectHub skill enables teams to set up complete project 
workspaces in seconds — including pages, databases, and 
templates — instead of spending 30 minutes on manual setup."
❌   Bad:
"The ProjectHub skill is a folder containing YAML frontmatter 
and Markdown instructions that calls our MCP server tools."
Highlight the MCP + skills story:
"Our MCP server gives Claude access to your Linear projects. 
Our skills teach Claude your team's sprint planning workflow. 
Together, they enable AI-powered project management."

Chapter 5
Patterns and 
troubleshooting

Chapter 5
Patterns and troubleshooting
These patterns emerged from skills created by early adopters and internal teams. 
They represent common approaches we've seen work well, not prescriptive 
templates. 
Choosing your approach: Problem-first vs. tool-first 
Think of it like Home Depot. Y ou might walk in with a problem - "I need to fix a 
kitchen cabinet" - and an employee points you to the right tools. Or you might 
pick out a new drill and ask how to use it for your specific job. 
Skills work the same way: 
• Problem-first: "I need to set up a project workspace" → Y our skill orchestrates 
the right MCP calls in the right sequence. Users describe outcomes; the skill 
handles the tools.
• Tool-first: "I have Notion MCP connected" → Y our skill teaches Claude the 
optimal workflows and best practices. Users have access; the skill provides 
expertise. 
Most skills lean one direction. Knowing which framing fits your use case helps 
you choose the right pattern below .
Pattern 1: Sequential workflow orchestration
Use when: Y our users need multi-step processes in a specific order .
Example structure:
-# Workflow: Onboard New Customer
--# Step 1: Create Account
Call MCP tool: `create_customer`
Parameters: name, email, company
--# Step 2: Setup Payment
Call MCP tool: `setup_payment_method`
Wait for: payment method verification
--# Step 3: Create Subscription
Call MCP tool: `create_subscription`
Parameters: plan_id, customer_id (from Step 1)
--# Step 4: Send Welcome Email
Call MCP tool: `send_email`
Template: welcome_email_template
Key techniques:
• Explicit step ordering
• Dependencies between steps
• V alidation at each stage
• Rollback instructions for failures
22

Pattern 2: Multi-MCP coordination
Use when: W orkflows span multiple services.
Example: Design-to-development handoff
--# Phase 1: Design Export (Figma MCP)
1. Export design assets from Figma
2. Generate design specifications
3. Create asset manifest
--# Phase 2: Asset Storage (Drive MCP)
1. Create project folder in Drive
2. Upload all assets
3. Generate shareable links
--# Phase 3: Task Creation (Linear MCP)
1. Create development tasks
2. Attach asset links to tasks
3. Assign to engineering team
--# Phase 4: Notification (Slack MCP)
1. Post handoff summary to #engineering
2. Include asset links and task references
Key techniques:
• Clear phase separation
• Data passing between MCPs
• V alidation before moving to next phase
• Centralized error handling
Pattern 3: Iterative refinement
Use when: Output quality improves with iteration.
Example: Report generation
-# Iterative Report Creation
--# Initial Draft
1. Fetch data via MCP
2. Generate first draft report
3. Save to temporary file
--# Quality Check
1. Run validation script: `scripts/check_report.py`
2. Identify issues:
   - Missing sections
   - Inconsistent formatting
   - Data validation errors
--# Refinement Loop
1. Address each identified issue
2. Regenerate affected sections
3. Re-validate
4. Repeat until quality threshold met
--# Finalization
1. Apply final formatting
2. Generate summary
3. Save final version
Key techniques:
• Explicit quality criteria
• Iterative improvement
• V alidation scripts
• Know when to stop iterating
23

Pattern 4: Context-aware tool selection
Use when: Same outcome, different tools depending on context.
Example: File storage
-# Smart File Storage
--# Decision Tree
1. Check file type and size
2. Determine best storage location:
   - Large files (>10MB): Use cloud storage MCP
   - Collaborative docs: Use Notion/Docs MCP
   - Code files: Use GitHub MCP
   - Temporary files: Use local storage
--# Execute Storage
Based on decision:
- Call appropriate MCP tool
- Apply service-specific metadata
- Generate access link
--# Provide Context to User
Explain why that storage was chosen
Key techniques:
• Clear decision criteria
• Fallback options
• Transparency about choices
Pattern 5: Domain-specific intelligence
Use when: Y our skill adds specialized knowledge beyond tool access.
Example: Financial compliance
-# Payment Processing with Compliance
--# Before Processing (Compliance Check)
1. Fetch transaction details via MCP
2. Apply compliance rules:
   - Check sanctions lists
   - Verify jurisdiction allowances  
   - Assess risk level
3. Document compliance decision
--# Processing
IF compliance passed:
  - Call payment processing MCP tool
  - Apply appropriate fraud checks
  - Process transaction
ELSE:
  - Flag for review
  - Create compliance case
--# Audit Trail
- Log all compliance checks
- Record processing decisions
- Generate audit report
Key techniques:
• Domain expertise embedded in logic
• Compliance before action
• Comprehensive documentation
• Clear governance
24

Troubleshooting
Skill won't upload
Error: "Could not find SKILL.md in uploaded folder"
Cause: File not named exactly SKILL.md
Solution:
• Rename to SKILL.md (case-sensitive)
• V erify with: ls -la should show SKILL.md
Error: "Invalid frontmatter"
Cause: Y AML formatting issue
Common mistakes:
# Wrong - missing delimiters
name: my-skill
description: Does things
# Wrong - unclosed quotes
name: my-skill
description: "Does things
# Correct
---
name: my-skill
description: Does things
---
Error: "Invalid skill name"
Cause: Name has spaces or capitals
# Wrong
name: My Cool Skill
# Correct  
name: my-cool-skill
Skill doesn't trigger
Symptom: Skill never loads automatically
Fix:
Revise your description field. See The Description Field for good/bad examples. 
Quick checklist:
• Is it too generic? ("Helps with projects" won't work)
• Does it include trigger phrases users would actually say?
• Does it mention relevant file types if applicable ?
Debugging approach:
Ask Claude: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" Claude will quote the 
description back. Adjust based on what's missing.
Skill triggers too often
Symptom: Skill loads for unrelated queries
Solutions:
1. Add negative triggers
description: Advanced data analysis for CSV files. Use for 
statistical modeling, regression, clustering. Do NOT use for 
simple data exploration (use data-viz skill instead).

2. Be more specific
# Too broad
description: Processes documents
# More specific
description: Processes PDF legal documents for contract review
3. Clarify scope
description: PayFlow payment processing for e-commerce. Use 
specifically for online payment workflows, not for general 
financial queries.
MCP connection issues
Symptom: Skill loads but MCP calls fail
Checklist:
1. V erify MCP server is connected
 – Claude.ai: Settings > Extensions > [Y our Service]
 – Should show "Connected" status
2. Check authentication
 – API keys valid and not expired
 – Proper permissions/ scopes granted
 – O Auth tokens refreshed
3. Test MCP independently
 – Ask Claude to call MCP directly (without skill)
 – "Use [Service] MCP to fetch my projects"
 – If this fails, issue is MCP not skill
4. V erify tool names
 – Skill references correct MCP tool names
 – Check MCP server documentation
 – T ool names are case-sensitive
Instructions not followed
Symptom: Skill loads but Claude doesn't follow instructions
Common causes:
1. Instructions too verbose
 – Keep instructions concise
 – Use bullet points and numbered lists
 – Move detailed reference to separate files
2. Instructions buried
 – Put critical instructions at the top
 – Use ## Important or ## Critical headers
 – Repeat key points if needed
3. Ambiguous language
# Bad
Make sure to validate things properly
# Good
CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify:
- Project name is non-empty
- At least one team member assigned
- Start date is not in the past
 Advanced technique: For critical validations, consider bundling a script 
that performs the checks programmatically rather than relying on language 
instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation isn't. See the Office 
skills for examples of this pattern.
4. Model "laziness" Add explicit encouragement:
-# Performance Notes
- Take your time to do this thoroughly
- Quality is more important than speed
- Do not skip validation steps
Note: Adding this to user prompts is more effective than in SKILL.md
26

Large context issues
Symptom: Skill seems slow or responses degraded
Causes:
• Skill content too large
• T oo many skills enabled simultaneously
• All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure
Solutions:
1. Optimize SKILL.md size
 – Move detailed docs to references/
 – Link to references instead of inline
 – Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words
2. Reduce enabled skills
 – Evaluate if you have more than 20 - 50 skills enabled simultaneously
 – Recommend selective enablement
 – Consider skill "packs" for related capabilities
