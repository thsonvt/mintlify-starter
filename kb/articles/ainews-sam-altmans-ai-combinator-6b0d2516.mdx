So I &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Wpxv-8nG8ec?si=yGgLELSHNJ4z5bLY&amp;t=1179">asked Sam&lt;/a> on his behalf:&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Swyx:&lt;/strong> &lt;em>I tend to think in terms of constraints. On the consumption side, human attention is the rate-limiting factor. On the production side&#8212;especially for builders&#8212;&lt;strong>the bottleneck is the quality of ideas&lt;/strong>. I spend a lot of time helping AI companies with GTM, and honestly, many of the products just aren&#8217;t worth people&#8217;s attention. So my question is: &lt;strong>what tools can we build to improve the quality of ideas people come up with?&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&#8212;-&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sama: &lt;/strong>&lt;em>&lt;strong>It&#8217;s popular to talk about &#8220;AI slop,&#8221; but there&#8217;s also a huge amount of human-generated slop in the world. &lt;/strong>(swyx: &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/IoiHI7p12Ao">we agree&lt;/a>!) Coming up with genuinely good, new ideas is hard. I increasingly believe that &lt;strong>we think at the limits of our tools&lt;/strong>, and that &lt;strong>we should explicitly try to build tools that help people think better&lt;/strong>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>As the cost of creation continues to plummet, we&#8217;ll be able to run much tighter feedback loops&#8212;try ideas faster, discard bad ones sooner, and find the good ones more reliably. If AI can discover new science and write very complex codebases, it seems obvious that there&#8217;s a much larger possibility space opening up.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>But today, a very common experience is sitting in front of an AI system&#8212;say, an agentic code writer&#8212;and &lt;strong>not knowing what to ask for next&lt;/strong>. A lot of people report this. &lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>I believe we can build tools to help you come up with good ideas.  I believe we could look at all your past work and all your past code and try to figure out what might be useful to you or interesting to you and and can just continuously suggest things. &lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>We can build really great brainstorming partners. &lt;strong>There have been like three or four people in my life that I have consistently found every time I hang out with them, I leave with a lot of ideas. They&#8217;re people who are just really good at asking questions or giving you seeds to build on.&lt;/strong> &lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>Paul Graham is off the charts amazing at this. If we could build something like a &#8220;Paul Graham bot&#8221; that you can have the same kind of interaction with to help generate new ideas, even if most of them are bad, even if you say &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; to 95% of them, I think something like that is going to be a very significant contribution to the amount of good stuff that gets built in the world. &lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>The models feel like they ought to be capable of that. With 5.2, a special version of 5.2 we use internally, &lt;strong>we&#8217;re now for the first time hearing from scientists that these the scientific progress of these models is no longer super trivial&lt;/strong>. And I just can&#8217;t believe that a model that can come up with new scientific insights is not also capable, with a different harness and trained a little bit differently, of &lt;strong>coming up with new insights about products to build&lt;/strong>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>You can catch the full text in his own words here: &lt;/p>&lt;div class="youtube-wrap" id="youtube2-Wpxv-8nG8ec">&lt;div class="youtube-inner">&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;h2>Reflections on &#8220;AI Paul Graham&#8221;&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are a few reactions I have here that I&#8217;ll fire off in quick succession:&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>It&#8217;s nice to see him acknowledge that the potential of AI is not just in helping to attract more attention through generated images and videos and marketing text (AI GTM, the first question from the town hall), but also it should be used in raising the quality of product, because there is a lot of &lt;strong>human-origin slop&lt;/strong> too!&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In many ways, Sam here is trying to bring in what YCombinator does for improving founder success to the general thought partnership capability of ChatGPT. Everyone could benefit from having their own personal YC Group Partner, on demand, no office hours. Much less having a PG-tier Partner. And yes, this is just the business form of the more general domain of advising and coaching, which probably everyone can benefit from &lt;strong>if we knew how to make it good enough&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Many, many people have tried to build an &#8220;AI Paul Graham&#8221; bot. These flopped because they mostly did RAG or finetunes on his essays. &lt;strong>Information Retrieval isn&#8217;t what PG -does-&lt;/strong> for Sam. He challenges you, runs you through multiple internal world models and pattern matches of past learned experiences, filters through what he should say to elicit the best response out of you instead of simply blurting out what he thinks token by token, and raises your ambitions.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>For both model trainers and agent harness builders, it&#8217;s instructive to draw a spectrum from the poorest implementation to the most ambitious implementation you can think of, and think about the sequencing of intelligent feedback and pushback you need.&lt;/p>&lt;div class="captioned-image-container">&lt;figure>&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oIXb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e605f33-4fd5-4eb8-9b10-1ac4ac8e9fb6_2656x912.png" target="_blank">&lt;div class="image2-inset">&lt;source type="image/webp" />&lt;img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="500" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oIXb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e605f33-4fd5-4eb8-9b10-1ac4ac8e9fb6_2656x912.png" width="1456" />&lt;div class="image-link-expand">&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset">&lt;button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image" tabindex="0" type="button">&lt;svg fill="none" height="20" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;g>&lt;title>&lt;/title>&lt;path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882">&lt;/path>&lt;/g>&lt;/svg>&lt;/button>&lt;button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image" tabindex="0" type="button">&lt;svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9">&lt;/polyline>&lt;polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15">&lt;/polyline>&lt;line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10">&lt;/line>&lt;line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14">&lt;/line>&lt;/svg>&lt;/button>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/a>&lt;/figure>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It is too lazy to wait for the God Model to arrive to do all these, there are probably concrete thought partner jobs that can be broken out into Agent Skills and MCP tools and Multi-agent Swarms and other tricks of the AI Engineer trade.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&#8220;Accuracy&#8221; for an AI PG is not 90%, not even 50% &#8212; even a 5% accurate PG is acceptable and valuable (and is probably reflective of most real life conversations with him - most questions or comments are NOT valuable, but a human filter on the comments will surface some very generative and out of distribution &#8220;seeds&#8221;). So this is a very scalable &#8220;throw shit at the wall&#8221; task where AI can act as mass generator and Humans can act as discriminator/judge, and &lt;strong>our existence proof that high-miss-rate question generation is still useful is YCombinator and Sam&#8217;s personal experience.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>When faced with &#8220;AI as thought partner&#8221; I see a lot of parallels with the alignment problem, and I often think about the &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/">Weak-to-Strong Superalignment&lt;/a> diagram:&lt;/p>&lt;div class="captioned-image-container">&lt;figure>&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bt39!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a27adf1-5470-41ab-aad4-4ee0c0a60bdf_2202x1322.png" target="_blank">&lt;div class="image2-inset">&lt;source type="image/webp" />&lt;img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="874" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bt39!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a27adf1-5470-41ab-aad4-4ee0c0a60bdf_2202x1322.png" width="1456" />&lt;div class="image-link-expand">&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset">&lt;button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image" tabindex="0" type="button">&lt;svg fill="none" height="20" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;g>&lt;title>&lt;/title>&lt;path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882">&lt;/path>&lt;/g>&lt;/svg>&lt;/button>&lt;button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image" tabindex="0" type="button">&lt;svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9">&lt;/polyline>&lt;polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15">&lt;/polyline>&lt;line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10">&lt;/line>&lt;line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14">&lt;/line>&lt;/svg>&lt;/button>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/a>&lt;figcaption class="image-caption">&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Where we are currently treating agents as a junior Software Engineer or &#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.latent.space/p/science">research intern&lt;/a>&#8221; (this is certainly the relationship we have with ChatGPT or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2cBTVr8nxU">Prism&lt;/a> today), we want to build the PG agent that is smarter than us, and perhaps the path there is to build smart agents for dumber people/usecases and then ladder up from there.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;div>&lt;hr />&lt;/div>&lt;h1>&lt;strong>AI Twitter Recap&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Frontier model &#8220;personality split&#8221; + how people are actually using them&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exploration vs. exploitation framing&lt;/strong>: One useful mental model: current frontier LLMs look like &#8220;polar opposites&#8221; where &lt;strong>GPT-5.2&lt;/strong> is optimized for &lt;em>exploration&lt;/em> (bigger search / richer reasoning, &#8220;xhigh and Pro&#8221; shine), while &lt;strong>Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/strong> is more &lt;em>exploitation&lt;/em> (stronger reliability with fewer tokens; extra &#8220;reasoning&#8221; often adds less) &#8212; implying OpenAI may be better positioned for research workflows, Anthropic for commercial reliability-heavy deployments (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2016335491243676058">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coding agent &#8220;phase shift&#8221; is real&#8212;but messy&lt;/strong>: Multiple posts reflect a step-change in practice: founders and engineers are increasingly running &#8220;agentic&#8221; coding loops, yet hitting new failure modes: agents that don&#8217;t ask clarifying questions, get &#8220;confused,&#8221; or edit unrelated files. Mikhail Parakhin describes reaching the point where he can specify a scheduler and trust it to work, but still can&#8217;t let agents loose on established codebases due to collateral edits (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MParakhin/status/2016362688444825833">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>). Related: workflow suggestions like &lt;em>self-verification&lt;/em> (e.g., Playwright screenshots + iterate-until-pass rules) are becoming common operational discipline (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2016335657602285822">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;div>&lt;hr />&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Kimi K2.5 (+ &#8220;clawdbot&#8221; / swarm-mode) becomes the week&#8217;s open-model flashpoint&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>K2.5 claims: agent + multimodal + coding polish&lt;/strong>: A long Zhihu-based synthesis argues &lt;strong>Kimi K2.5&lt;/strong> upgrades K2&#8217;s &#8220;intelligence &gt; capability&#8221; imbalance by strengthening &lt;strong>agent execution&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>multimodality&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>coding&lt;/strong>, reducing brute-force token usage and improving instruction-following stability; still flagged: hallucinations and a persistent NBSP formatting quirk (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2016363957876097089">thread&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>). A second Zhihu recap makes a pragmatic case for multimodality: &#8220;vision&#8221; matters when agents need to verify UI state (overlaps, broken images, visual regressions), enabling tighter action&#8211;critic loops with less human feedback (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2016438778030850059">thread&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Distribution + local runs are driving hype&lt;/strong>: Reports of K2.5 being runnable on high-end Apple silicon setups went viral: &lt;strong>~24 tok/s&lt;/strong> using &lt;strong>2&#215; 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studios&lt;/strong> connected via &lt;strong>Thunderbolt 5 (RDMA)&lt;/strong> with &lt;strong>Exo Labs / MLX&lt;/strong> backend (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexocheema/status/2016404573917683754">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>). Kimi also pushed an AMA on r/LocalLLaMA (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016443435553890419">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>) and announced availability on &#8220;Eigent&#8221; (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016473945957155252">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Benchmarks + pricing pressure&lt;/strong>: Kilo Code promoted a free week, claiming K2.5 beats Opus 4.5 on several coding benchmarks (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kilocode/status/2016449095511007535">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>); Kimi&#8217;s own account claimed &#8220;#1 open model for coding&#8221; (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016521406906028533">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>). An anecdotal A/B/C test on UI-from-image generation found Opus best quality but pricey, Codex fastest/cheapest but lower fidelity, and K2.5 ~&#8220;90% of Opus quality at ~38% cost&#8221; (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JuanPa/status/2016634998988865571">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Licensing friction as an adoption blocker&lt;/strong>: A pointed note argues modified licenses + logo requirements can kill enterprise adoption even if the model is excellent (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2016531878795256286">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&#8220;Clawdbot&#8221; as a cultural artifact&lt;/strong>: The meme itself (people confused about what &#8220;clawdbot&#8221; even is) reflects how fast agent branding and forks proliferate (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dejavucoder/status/2016341138740052126">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>), and sets up broader concerns about ecosystem signal loss (see below).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;div>&lt;hr />&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Agent engineering: skills, harnesses, evals, and &#8220;reliability tax&#8221;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Skills are crystallizing into a shared interface layer&lt;/strong>: A major theme is moving workflow logic out of prompts into reusable &#8220;skills&#8221; (files/folders of instructions, loaded on demand).

Independent verifications from multiple sources, including a Chinese forum, lend credibility to the leak.&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The leaked system prompt for Kimi K2.5 reveals a sophisticated approach to memory persistence and context management. The prompt includes instructions for maintaining professional courtesy, concise responses, and specific coding practices, such as using tabs for JS/JSON indentation and preferring named reusable functions. This structure aims to address the &#8216;hollow AI assistant&#8217; problem by providing persistent behavioral anchors, which can significantly affect the model&#8217;s ability to maintain personality consistency across sessions.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The memory persistence mechanism in Kimi K2.5 is particularly noteworthy. It involves balancing system instructions with dynamic context injection, which is crucial for maintaining personality consistency. The system&#8217;s approach to conversation summarization or retrieval can influence new chats, and even minor changes in memory structuring can lead to shifts in the model&#8217;s responses, sometimes making them feel more &#8216;authentic.&#8217; This highlights the importance of initial prompt structure in determining whether an AI &#8216;remembers&#8217; its behavioral patterns or just factual content.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The system prompt for Kimi K2.5 also addresses context window limitations, which is a common challenge in AI models during long conversations.

Agentic Frontiers: Vision, Coding, and Future Forecasts&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Karpathy Predicts 80% Agent-Coded Future&lt;/strong>: Andrej Karpathy forecast that &lt;strong>80% of coding&lt;/strong> will be agent-driven by 2026, relying on LLMs&#8217; increasing tenacity and goal-setting rather than human syntax management (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://xcancel.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876">tweet&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>). Simultaneously, discussions on &lt;strong>agentic harnesses&lt;/strong> suggest that smart models will soon replace complex orchestrators like &lt;strong>LangChain&lt;/strong> in favor of filesystem-based collaboration.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Gemini 3 Flash Gains Agentic Vision&lt;/strong>: Google introduced &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/agentic-vision-gemini-3-flash/">Agentic Vision&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for &lt;strong>Gemini 3 Flash&lt;/strong>, enabling the model to actively zoom, crop, and inspect images to ground its reasoning. Front-end developers report this capability is nearing &lt;strong>SOTA&lt;/strong>, outperforming OpenAI&#8217;s static analysis by dynamically manipulating visual inputs.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>C++ Reigns Supreme for Agents&lt;/strong>: In a push against &#8220;bloated&#8221; Python frameworks, engineers argued that high-performance agents should be built in &lt;strong>C++&lt;/strong>, recommending stacks like &lt;strong>fastwhisper.cpp&lt;/strong> for STT and &lt;strong>LFM2.5vl&lt;/strong> for vision. This aligns with the release of a &lt;strong>LeetCode MCP server&lt;/strong> that allows Claude to solve coding challenges directly from the terminal.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Theme 5. Low-Level Optimization &amp; Hardware Internals&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Decart&#8217;s Lucy 2 &amp; Hardware Hiring&lt;/strong>: Decart released &lt;strong>Lucy 2&lt;/strong>, an autoregressive video model, and is actively hiring for &lt;strong>Trainium 3&lt;/strong> and low-latency kernel development (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://x.com/DecartAI/status/2016134190509498740">tech report&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>). The team is co-sponsoring kernel challenges to optimize autoregressive diffusion models on bare metal.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mojo Generates GTK Bindings&lt;/strong>: The &lt;strong>Modular&lt;/strong> team announced autogenerated &lt;strong>GTK bindings&lt;/strong> for Mojo, promising easier GUI development to be showcased at their February community meeting. Engineers are also analyzing &lt;strong>Mojo vs CUDA/HIP&lt;/strong> performance on H100s, debating if Mojo&#8217;s &lt;code>out&lt;/code> parameters successfully replace Named Value Return Optimization (NVRO).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tinygrad Unlocks AMD Debugging&lt;/strong>: The &lt;strong>Tinygrad&lt;/strong> emulator now supports granular debug printing for AMD GPUs (&lt;code>DEBUG=3&lt;/code> for compilation, &lt;code>DEBUG=6&lt;/code> for runtime), as seen in this &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1068976834928193609/1465889714153193574/image.png">screenshot&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Contributors are also optimizing &lt;strong>Github Actions&lt;/strong> speeds via code refactoring rather than hardware upgrades, adhering to a &#8220;do it right, not just fast&#8221; philosophy.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>
