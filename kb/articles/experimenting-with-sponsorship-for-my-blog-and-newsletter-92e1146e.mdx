## Full Article

19th February 2026 I've long been resistant to the idea of accepting sponsorship for my blog. I value my credibility as an independent voice, and I don't want to risk compromising that reputation. Then I learned about Troy Hunt's approach to sponsorship, which he first wrote about in 2016. Troy runs with a simple text row in the page banner - no JavaScript, no cookies, unobtrusive while providing value to the sponsor. I can live with that! Accepting sponsorship in this way helps me maintain my independence while offsetting the opportunity cost of not taking a full-time job. To start with I'm selling sponsorship by the week. Sponsors get that unobtrusive banner across my blog and also their sponsored message at the top of my newsletter. I will not write content in exchange for sponsorship. I hope the sponsors I work with understand that my credibility as an independent voice is a key reason I have an audience, and compromising that trust would be bad for everyone. Freeman & Forrest helped me set up and sell my first slots. Thanks also to Theo Browne for helping me think through my approach.
