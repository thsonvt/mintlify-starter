I've long been resistant to the idea of accepting sponsorship for my blog. I value my credibility as an independent voice, and I don't want to risk compromising that reputation.

Then I learned about Troy Hunt's [approach to sponsorship](https://www.troyhunt.com/sponsorship/), which he first wrote about [in 2016](https://www.troyhunt.com/im-now-offering-sponsorship-of-this-blog/). Troy runs with a simple text row in the page banner - no JavaScript, no cookies, unobtrusive while providing value to the sponsor. I can live with that!

Accepting sponsorship in this way helps me maintain my independence while offsetting the opportunity cost of not taking a full-time job.

To start with I'm selling sponsorship by the week. Sponsors get that unobtrusive banner across my blog and also their sponsored message at the top of [my newsletter](https://simonw.substack.com/).

![Screenshot of my blog's homepage. Below the Simon Willison's Weblog heading and list of tags is a new blue page-wide banner reading ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/sponsor-banner.jpg)

I **will not write content in exchange for sponsorship**. I hope the sponsors I work with understand that my credibility as an independent voice is a key reason I have an audience, and compromising that trust would be bad for everyone.

[Freeman & Forrest](https://www.freemanandforrest.com/) helped me set up and sell my first slots. Thanks also to [Theo Browne](https://t3.gg/) for helping me think through my approach.
