**a good ship from Qwen.**

Congrats to [Pete Steinberger on joining OpenAI](https://x.com/sama/status/2023150230905159801), as we [predicted](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-sci-fi-with-a-touch-of-madness). Not much else to add there so we won’t.

Today’s headliner is Qwen 3.5, which followed the other Chinese model labs like [Z.ai](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-zai-glm-5-new-sota-open-weights) and [Minimax](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-new-gemini-3-deep-think-anthropic) and [Kimi](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-moonshot-kimi-k25-beats-sonnet) in refreshing their leading models, but unlike the first two, Qwen 3.5 is in the same weight class as Kimi, 400B with about a 4.3% sparsity ratio instead of Kimi’s more agressive 3.25%. They do not claim SOTA across the board, and most notably not across coding benchmarks, but make solid improvements compared to [Qwen3-Max](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-09-05-1t-models) and [Qwen3-VL](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-09-23-alibaba-yunqi).

Native Multimodality and [Spatial Intelligence](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.5#spatial-intelligence) are headline features of the model and we encourage clicking over to the blog to check out the examples, as there isn’t much else to say - this is a very welcome headline model refresh from China’s most prolific open model lab, and probably the last before DeepSeek v4.
