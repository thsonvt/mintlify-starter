Reached the stage of parallel agent psychosis where I've lost a whole feature - I know I had it yesterday, but I can't seem to find the branch or worktree or cloud instance or checkout with it in.

... found it! Turns out I'd been hacking on a random prototype in `/tmp` and then my computer crashed and rebooted and I lost the code... but it's all still there in `~/.claude/projects/` session logs and Claude Code can extract it out and spin up the missing feature again.
