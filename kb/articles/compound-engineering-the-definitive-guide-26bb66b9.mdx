Software used to be built by armies of engineers. Now, with AI, Every runs all five of its products with single-person engineering teams.

When I started building **Cora**, our AI email assistant, from scratch, I wanted to see how much I could enable myself with AI. I knew it was possible for one person to ship like five. All I had to do was build the right systems and the right productivity hacks.

This evolved into a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that I call compound engineering. It now has 7,000 stars on GitHub, which confirms my belief that this will become the default for how software gets built.
