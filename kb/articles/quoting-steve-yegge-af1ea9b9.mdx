## Summary

Getting agents using Beads requires much less prompting, because Beads now has 4 months of “Desire Paths” design. Getting agents using Beads requires much less prompting, because Beads now has 4 months of “Desire Paths” design, which I’ve talked about before. Beads has evolved a very complex command-line interface, with 100+ subcommands, each with many sub-subcommands, aliases, alternate syntaxes, and other aff
