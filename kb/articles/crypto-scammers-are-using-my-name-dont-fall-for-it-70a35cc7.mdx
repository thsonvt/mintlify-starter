I woke up this morning to discover that, without my knowledge or consent, someone had created an ICO using the Superpowers name and my Twitter username. They emailed me excitedly to tell me that I'd already made $800 in royalties.

I asked them to take it down and to take my name off of it.

They said they'd done that. But...it's still there.

I have nothing to do with this ICO.

You should not put money into it.

It is a scam.
