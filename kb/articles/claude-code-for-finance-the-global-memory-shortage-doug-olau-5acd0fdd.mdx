First speakers for AIE Europe and AIEi Miami have been announced. If youre in Asia/Aus, come by Singapore and Melbourne. AI Engineering is going global!One year ago today, Anthropic launched Claude Code, to not much fanfare:The word of mouth was incredibly strong however, and so we were glad to be one of the first podcasts to invite Boris and Cat on in early May:As we discussed on the pod, all CC usage was API-based and therefore it was ridiculously expensive to do anything. This was then fixed by the team including Claude Code in the Claude Pro plan in early June, and then the virality caused us to make a rare trend call in late June:Now, 6 months on, Doug has just calculated that around 4% of GitHub is written by Claude Code:We talk about how Doug uses Claude Code to do SemiAnalysis work.Memory ManiaIn the second part of this episode, we also check in on Memory Mania, which is going to affect you (yes, you) at home if it hasnt already:Full Episode on YouTubeTimestamps00:00 AI as Junior Analyst00:59 Meet Swyx and Doug03:30 From Value Mule to Semis06:28 Moores Law Ends Thesis12:02 Claude Code Awakening32:02 Agent Swarms Reality Check32:53 Kimi Swarm Benchmarks37:31 Bots vs Zapier Automation39:44 Claude Code Workflow Setup57:54 AGI Metrics and GDP01:04:48 Railroad CapEx Analogy01:06:00 Funding Bubbles and Demand01:08:11 Agents Replace Work Tools01:13:56 Codex vs Claude Race01:21:15 Microsoft and TPU Strategy01:34:13 TPU Window vs Nvidia01:36:30 HBM Supply Chain Squeeze01:39:41 Memory Shock and CXL01:45:20 Context Rationing Future01:54:37 Writing and Trail LessonsTranscript[00:00:00] AI as Junior Analyst[00:00:00] Doug: This crap makes mistakes all the time. All the time. It is still just like a, like I think of it once again as like a junior analyst, right? The analyst goes and does all this like really pain in the ass information and you bring it all together to make a good decision at the top. Historically what happens is that junior analyst, who I once was, went and gathered all that information, and after doing this enough times, theres a meta level thinking thats happening where its like, okay, heres what I really understand and how this type of analysis, Im an expert in, actually Im very good at, I consistently have a hit rate.[00:00:28] Now Im the expert, right? I dont think that meta level learning is there yet. Well see if l ones do it, right? Everyone whos spending one quadrillion dollars in the world thinks it will, it better, it better happen by if youre spending, you know, a trillion dollars and theres not meta level learning.[00:00:44] But for me, in our firm, that massively amplifies everyone who is an expert. cause like you have to still do something that you can just like lop it up. Its very obvious to me. What Its slop.[00:00:59] Meet Swyx and Doug Read more
