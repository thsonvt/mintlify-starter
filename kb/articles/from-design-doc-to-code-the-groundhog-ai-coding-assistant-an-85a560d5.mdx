## Summary

You’re using Cursor incorrectly. Ello everyone, in the "[Yes, Claude Code can decompile itself. Here's the source code](https://ghuntley.com/tradecraft)" blog post, I teased about a new meta when using Cursor. This post is a follow-up to the post below.

## Key Insights

> "You’re using Cursor incorrectly."

When you use "[/specs](https://ghuntley.com/specs)" (this post) method with the "[stdlib](https://ghuntley.com/stdlib)" (above) method in conjunction with a programming language that provides compiler soundness (driven by good types) and compiler errors, the results are incredible. You can drive hands-free output of N factor (entire weeks' worth) of co-workers in hours.
