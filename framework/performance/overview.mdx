After the Rehearsal achieves 90-95% confidence, the workflow shifts to **fast execution** followed by **layered polish**.

## Time Distribution

- **Performance (Execution)**: ~5% of total time
- **Polish (AI + Human Review)**: ~20% of total time

**Why so fast?** When the plan is solid, implementation becomes straightforward.

## Essential Topics for Delivery

| Topic | Key Takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| **Observation vs. Autonomy** | Implementation is a "coherent dream"; you must watch the first few seconds carefully |
| **Holistic Review** | AI is better at reviewing a finished file than it is at writing it line-by-line |
| **Layered Polishing** | Separate high-level structural fixes from low-level linting to avoid confusing the model |
| **Agentic Mechanics** | Use the AI to interact with tools like `gh` (GitHub CLI) to automate the "boring" parts of the finish line |

## The Four Steps

### [The Performance: Execution](/framework/performance/execution)
Active observation as the AI implements the vetted plan

### [The Polish: Pass 1 (AI Self-Review)](/framework/performance/polish-ai-review)
AI performs holistic review and identifies gaps before human review

### [The Polish: Pass 2 (Human Review)](/framework/performance/polish-human-review)
Engineer applies taste, judgment, and catches invisible constraints

### [Shipping the Work](/framework/performance/shipping)
Automated commit messages, PR descriptions, and final delivery

**Key Principle**: Performance is fast because the Rehearsal was thorough. Polish is layered to maintain quality without chaos.
