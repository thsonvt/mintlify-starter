**Goal**: Use AI to handle the cognitive overhead of documenting and delivering the work.

## Automated Accounting

The AI handles the **cognitive gear-shift** of writing descriptive commit messages and Pull Request (PR) descriptions.

**Why this matters**: Your brain is in "implementation mode"—switching to "documentation mode" is expensive.

## Writing Commit Messages

Ask the AI to generate commit messages based on the chat history.

### Example Prompt
```
Please write a conventional commit message for these changes.
Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
Keep subject under 72 characters.
Include a body that explains the "why" behind the changes.
```

### What Good Commit Messages Look Like

**Bad**:
```
fix: updates
```

**Good**:
```
feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation

Implements automatic token rotation to improve security.
Refresh tokens now expire after 7 days and are rotated
on each use. Adds middleware to handle token validation
and renewal transparently.

Closes #123
```

### Automated Message Generation

For work done in a single chat session:
```
"Based on our conversation, generate a commit message
that summarizes what we implemented and why."
```

For work spanning multiple sessions:
```
"Run 'git diff main' and summarize all changes on this
branch into a comprehensive commit message."
```

## Contextual Commits

For work spanning **multiple sessions**, ensure the AI has full context.

### The Problem
AI only sees the current chat—it doesn't know about earlier sessions.

### The Solution
Prompt the AI to run `git diff` to see all changes:

```
"Run 'git diff main...HEAD' to see all changes on this branch.
Then write a commit message that covers everything, not just
what we discussed in this session."
```

### What This Prevents
- Incomplete commit messages
- Missing context from earlier work
- Commits that don't reflect full scope

## Writing PR Descriptions

Generate comprehensive PR descriptions from the full context.

### PR Description Template
```
"Please write a pull request description with:

## Summary
Brief overview of what this PR does

## Changes
Detailed list of changes made

## Testing
How this was tested

## Screenshots (if applicable)
Any visual changes

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
```

### Example Prompt
```
"Based on our complete conversation and the git diff,
please write a comprehensive PR description following
the template above. Focus on the 'why' and 'what',
not just the 'how'."
```

## Using GitHub CLI (`gh`)

Leverage the AI to interact with **`gh` (GitHub CLI)** for automated workflows.

### Creating PRs Automatically

```
"Use the gh CLI to:
1. Create a new PR from this branch
2. Use the PR description we just wrote
3. Add labels: 'enhancement', 'needs-review'
4. Request review from @teammate
5. Link to issue #123"
```

### What the AI Generates
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation" \
  --body "$(cat pr-description.md)" \
  --label enhancement,needs-review \
  --reviewer teammate \
  --web
```

**Pro tip**: Review the command before execution (remember: shell commands can't be undone).

## Agentic Mechanics

Use AI to automate the **"boring" parts** of the finish line:

### Automate These Tasks
- ✅ Write commit messages
- ✅ Generate PR descriptions
- ✅ Update changelogs
- ✅ Create release notes
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Run final checks (tests, linting)

### Keep Human Control Over
- ❌ Merging to main/master
- ❌ Production deployments
- ❌ Breaking changes
- ❌ Security-sensitive operations

## Pre-Ship Checklist

Before shipping, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] No debug statements or console.logs
- [ ] Git diff reviewed manually
- [ ] Commit message is descriptive
- [ ] PR description is comprehensive
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline will pass

**If anything fails**: Fix before shipping, don't "fix it later."

## The Final Push

### Standard Workflow
```bash
# AI helps generate
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation

Implements automatic token rotation for improved security.
[full description]"

# AI helps create PR
gh pr create --web

# Human reviews and merges
# (Keep final merge control)
```

**Key Principle**: AI handles documentation overhead. You maintain control over delivery decisions. Automate the boring, control the critical.
