**Goal**: Apply your unique expertise and judgment that the AI cannot replicate.

## The Final Arbiter

The engineer applies **unique taste and judgment** to the diffs, focusing on:
- Architecture alignment
- "Invisible constraints" the AI might have missed
- Domain-specific best practices
- Long-term maintainability

**Your role**: Catch what the AI fundamentally cannot know or reason about.

## What to Focus On

### 1. Architectural Alignment
- Does this match our system's design principles?
- Will this be maintainable 6 months from now?
- Does it create technical debt?
- Is it consistent with existing patterns?

### 2. Invisible Constraints
Things the AI can't know:
- Unwritten team conventions
- Historical decisions and context
- Political/organizational constraints
- Performance requirements from experience
- Security policies not in documentation

### 3. Domain Expertise
- Does this make sense for our specific use case?
- Are there edge cases from production experience?
- Will this scale with our traffic patterns?
- Does it align with business logic nuances?

### 4. Code Review Standards
- Readability for your team
- Testability and debugging ease
- Error messages that actually help
- Documentation that adds value

## Training Foresight

Significant divergences between the plan and the code are **learning moments**.

### When Code Deviates from Plan

**Don't just fix it—understand it**:

```
"I notice the implementation differs from our plan here.
Why did this happen? What did we miss in the Rehearsal?"
```

### Common Root Causes

**Missing Context**: AI didn't have critical information
- **Fix**: Update bootstrapping process to include this

**Ambiguous Plan**: Plan wasn't specific enough
- **Fix**: Add more detail to future plan specifications

**Constraint Discovery**: Found a limitation during implementation
- **Fix**: Note this constraint for future reference

**Model Limitation**: AI made a reasoning error
- **Fix**: Add validation checkpoint for this type of work

### Creating a Feedback Loop

Document patterns you discover:
1. What went wrong
2. Why it went wrong
3. How to prevent it next time

**Pro tip**: Keep a `lessons-learned.md` file for recurring patterns.

## Collaborative Debugging

If testing reveals bugs, use the AI for **root cause analysis (RCA)** before jumping to fixes.

### The RCA Protocol

**Step 1: Provide Evidence**
```
"The tests are failing with this error:
[paste full error message]

Here's the relevant test output:
[paste test output]

Here's a screenshot of the behavior:
[attach screenshot if applicable]
```

**Step 2: Request Analysis**
```
"Please analyze the root cause of this failure.
Don't suggest a fix yet—just identify why this is happening."
```

**Step 3: Validate Understanding**
Review the AI's analysis. Does it make sense?
- ✅ If yes → Ask for fix proposal
- ❌ If no → Provide more context or correct the understanding

**Step 4: Collaborative Fix**
```
"That analysis makes sense. Please propose 2-3
approaches to fix this, with pros and cons for each."
```

### Why This Works Better

**Bad approach**: "This is broken, fix it"
- AI guesses randomly
- May fix symptoms, not root cause
- Likely to introduce new bugs

**Good approach**: Evidence → Analysis → Understanding → Targeted Fix
- AI reasons through the problem
- Identifies actual root cause
- Proposes thoughtful solutions

## The Review Checklist

Before approving the implementation:

- [ ] Matches the original plan's intent
- [ ] Handles all identified edge cases
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] No obvious security issues
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] Tests cover critical paths
- [ ] No "magic" that team won't understand
- [ ] Documentation is adequate
- [ ] Aligns with team conventions

**If any item fails**: Don't merge. Address the gap.

**Key Principle**: You are the final arbiter. The AI executed the plan—you ensure it's actually correct, complete, and maintainable.
