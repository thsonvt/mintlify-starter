**Duration: 5 Minutes**

## The Problem

Most senior engineers eventually hit a wall where AI feels like it's making **more work** than it's saving.

## The Cause

This happens because **"vibe coding"**—writing a prompt and hoping for the best—does not scale to enterprise codebases filled with "invisible constraints" like:

- Unwritten architectural patterns
- Complex dependency chains
- Legacy system integrations
- Team-specific conventions

## The Reality Check

AI isn't a "magic black box" but a **system with predictable failure modes**:

- **Confident hallucinations**: AI generates plausible-looking but incorrect code
- **"Helpful" refactors**: Changes that seem good but break unrelated code
- **Context blindness**: Missing critical constraints outside the immediate scope

The solution isn't to abandon AI—it's to evolve how we work with it.
