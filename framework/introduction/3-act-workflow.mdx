**Duration: 5 Minutes**

## The Framework

This workshop teaches a disciplined workflow in three acts:

### Act 1: Rehearsal (~75% of time)

**Deep collaborative thinking** to build a shared understanding and a vetted plan.

- Define the problem space completely
- Explore constraints and edge cases
- Build a detailed execution plan
- Validate assumptions before coding

**Why this takes most of the time**: Getting alignment upfront prevents expensive rework later.

### Act 2: Performance (~5% of time)

**Fast execution** of the well-vetted plan.

- AI implements the agreed-upon design
- Engineer monitors and guides
- Rapid iteration on implementation details

**Why this is so fast**: When the plan is solid, execution is straightforward.

### Act 3: Polish (~20% of time)

**Closing the loop** through multiple verification layers:

1. **Self-review**: Does it match the plan?
2. **Automated checks**: Tests, linting, type checking
3. **Human verification**: Code review and integration testing

**Why this matters**: Quality gates ensure nothing ships broken.

## The Inversion

Traditional development: 5% planning, 75% coding, 20% debugging
AI-assisted development: 75% planning, 5% coding, 20% verification

The effort shifts from writing code to ensuring correctness.
