## How AI Actually Works

Stop viewing AI as a "human-like actor" and instead view it as a **Scriptwriter**.

## The Predictive Nature

The AI's only job is to:
1. Look at the entire conversation history (the "script")
2. Predict the next most likely token

That's it. There's no reasoning, no understanding—just pattern prediction based on training data.

## The Context Window

**Critical insight**: For the AI, the context window is its entire world.

- If information isn't in that window, **it literally does not exist** to the AI
- No access to previous conversations (unless explicitly provided)
- No memory of past interactions
- No awareness of your broader codebase (unless shown)

### What This Means for You

- You must **explicitly provide** all relevant context
- Assume nothing is "obvious" to the AI
- The quality of output is directly tied to the quality of input

The Scriptwriter needs a good script to work with.
