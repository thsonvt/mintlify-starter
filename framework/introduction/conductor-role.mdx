**Duration: 5 Minutes**

## The Analogy

A Conductor isn't:
- ❌ The musician (playing every note themselves)
- ❌ The composer (completely detached from execution)

A Conductor is:
- ✅ **In close sync** with the performer through the entire process
- ✅ Guiding, shaping, and refining in real-time
- ✅ Maintaining the vision while delegating execution

## Managing Parallelism

Once a workflow is disciplined and predictable, a senior engineer can direct **3–6 workstreams in parallel**:

- Feature A: AI implements auth flow
- Feature B: AI writes test suite
- Feature C: AI refactors legacy module
- Feature D: AI generates documentation
- Feature E: AI optimizes database queries
- Feature F: AI sets up CI/CD pipeline

You orchestrate, review, and guide—not write every line.

## The Power Shift

Mastering this role moves work from:

**Before**: "Writing a function faster"
**After**: "Building a whole feature in the time it used to take to write a function"

This is the 10x productivity leap that's actually achievable.
