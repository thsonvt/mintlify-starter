The objective of the Rehearsal is to **front-load all hard, collaborative thinking** before a single line of code is written.

## The Goal: Correctness and Completeness

A successful Rehearsal ensures the plan is:
- ✅ **Correct**: Accurately reflects intent
- ✅ **Complete**: Addresses all critical areas and gaps

**The ROI**: Every minute spent here saves ten minutes of patching "AI slop" later.

## Essential Topics for Delivery

| Topic | Key Takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| **Active Context Management** | You are responsible for the AI's "working memory" |
| **Constraint Navigation** | AI fails when it hits unwritten rules; the Rehearsal makes these rules explicit |
| **Quantitative Validation** | The confidence score is a "gut check" for readiness, not a guarantee of perfection |
| **The "AI-Friendly" Mindset** | Treat the AI like a smart intern: guide it, don't just prompt it |

## The Three Steps

### [Step 1: Bootstrapping](/framework/rehearsal/bootstrapping)
Building the AI's world by explicitly directing context creation

### [Step 2: Idea Shaping](/framework/rehearsal/idea-shaping)
Design and constraint exploration before implementation

### [Step 3: Confidence Tuning](/framework/rehearsal/confidence-tuning)
The pre-flight check to ensure total synchronization

**Time Investment**: ~75% of the total workflow
**Why**: Getting alignment upfront prevents expensive rework later
