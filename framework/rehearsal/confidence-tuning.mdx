**Goal**: Quantitatively verify that both you and the AI are ready for implementation.

## The Confidence Prompt

Ask the AI for a **quantitative confidence score** (0-100%) and a list of remaining ambiguities.

### Example Prompt
```
On a scale of 0-100%, how confident are you that:
1. You understand the requirements completely
2. The proposed plan will work
3. You've identified all edge cases
4. There are no missing dependencies

For each area below 95%, what specifically is unclear?
```

### What You're Looking For
- ✅ **90-100%**: Ready to proceed
- ⚠️ **70-89%**: Specific gaps identified, address them
- ❌ **Below 70%**: Not ready, more exploration needed

## Closing the Loop

Use the AI to **review its own plan** to surface edge cases or missing error handling that you might have overlooked.

### Self-Review Prompts

**Edge Case Discovery**
```
"Review this plan and list all edge cases we haven't discussed.
What could go wrong? What assumptions are we making?"
```

**Error Handling Check**
```
"For each step in the plan, what errors could occur?
Do we have a strategy for handling each one?"
```

**Integration Points**
```
"What external systems or modules does this touch?
What happens if any of them are unavailable?"
```

**Performance Considerations**
```
"Are there any performance implications we haven't addressed?
What happens under high load?"
```

## The 90-95% Rule

Guidelines for iterating on the plan until a **high confidence score** is reached.

### Iteration Process

1. **Ask for confidence score** → Note areas below 95%
2. **Address each gap** → Discuss, decide, document
3. **Re-check confidence** → Score should increase
4. **Repeat until 90-95%** → Ready for implementation

### When to Stop Iterating

You've reached the point of diminishing returns when:
- Confidence is consistently 90-95%
- No new ambiguities are being surfaced
- Further discussion is speculative, not actionable
- You have a clear implementation plan

**Important**: 100% confidence is a red flag—it means you or the AI is overconfident. 90-95% is the sweet spot.

## Total Sync Checklist

Before moving to implementation, verify:

- [ ] AI has read all relevant files
- [ ] Architecture is clearly understood
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Edge cases are documented
- [ ] Error handling strategy is defined
- [ ] Testing approach is clear
- [ ] Naming conventions are agreed upon
- [ ] Confidence score is 90-95%
- [ ] No major ambiguities remain

**If any item is unchecked**: Go back to Bootstrapping or Idea Shaping.

**Key Principle**: The Rehearsal is complete when both human and AI have 90-95% confidence. Not before. Not at 100%.
