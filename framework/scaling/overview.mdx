Once individual engineers master the workflow, the next challenge is **scaling this approach across teams** and leading the organizational transition.

## The Challenge

Individual productivity increases 3x–10x, but this creates new challenges:
- **PR flood**: More output requires new review strategies
- **Knowledge sharing**: Individual success must scale to team adoption
- **Cultural shift**: Moving from tribal knowledge to codified practices

## Essential Topics for Delivery

| Topic | Key Takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| **From Manual to Agentic Review** | Use AI to handle the "tedious nits" so humans can focus on architecture and taste |
| **The REVIEW_RULES.md** | Tribal knowledge must be codified to be enforceable at scale |
| **The "One-Way Door"** | Once an engineer masters this workflow, the old way of working feels cumbersome and they rarely go back |
| **Psychological Safety** | Frame the transition as individual impact multiplication and career growth, not replacement |

## The Three Pillars

### [Taming the PR Flood](/framework/scaling/pr-review-bottleneck)
Shifting AI from "coder" to "reviewer" to handle the review bottleneck

### [Cultivating an AI-Friendly Codebase](/framework/scaling/ai-friendly-codebase)
Building artifacts and documentation that enable instant AI context

### [Leadership: Focus on Growth](/framework/scaling/leadership-adoption)
Leading human-first adoption with champions, not mandates

**Key Insight**: The transition from individual mastery to team adoption is primarily a **human challenge**, not a technical one.
