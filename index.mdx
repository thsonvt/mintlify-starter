description: "Welcome to the AI Conductor Framework"
---
Most senior engineers hit a wall where AI feels like it's making more work than it's saving. This happens because "vibe coding"—writing a prompt and hoping for the best—doesn't scale to enterprise codebases filled with invisible constraints. To go beyond the vibe, engineers must evolve from coders to Conductors who systematically orchestrate AI
through a disciplined 3-Act workflow: Rehearsal, Performance, and Polish. 

This framework unlocks the ability to direct 3-6 workstreams in parallel, achieving the 10x productivity leap that's actually achievable—not hype. 

Once mastered individually, these practices scale across teams, transforming how entire engineering organizations ship production-quality code with AI.
